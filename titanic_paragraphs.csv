0,1,"Stop it ! I told you stop it . Stop it , I said ! Make him stop it . [ baby cries ] What happened , Alice ? What happened ? We 're all going to die . Bring those pump lines in here now ! Come on , move it ! That 's it , laddies ! Some of the lads down below say they got water in their rooms . You can 't take that seriously . Somebody 's making it up . Yeah , well , I 'm not waing around to find out . Where you going ? I 'm gong up . Up out of the damp , thank you . My God . Water . There 's bloomin ' water coming in !"
1,2,"[ knock on door ] ALlCE : Mr. Allison ? Sir , there 's something wrong ! Another nightmare . She 's having another nightmare . Oh , that girl . I tell you , Hudson ... [ knocking ] Mr. Allison ! I 'm coming . The baby . What about the baby ? There was a scraping sound , and it woke him up , and I got him quiet , but there 's some kind of trouble with the boat , sir . The engines have stopped . You hear it , Hudson ? I hope you 're satisfied . We 've probably stopped for the night because of ice . It 's nothing to be concerned about . We hit something , sir . I felt it . I felt it in my bones . It was like in my nightmares . Stop it , Alice ."
2,3,"Now . I mean it . This boat 's unsinkable . Nothing is wrong . Yes , sir , But I fel -- But , sir ... You 're too soft- hearted with that girl . When we arrive in New York , she goes . [ faint thudding and creaking ] Ship is going down . People screaming . Bodies floating in the water . Chairs , tables ... and a baby . A dead baby in a cold water , night dress round his head . I seen it . She has taken damage along 300 feet of her starboard side . Oh , my God . You have broken one of the cardinal rules of safety . Never turn over broadside to danger . Had we struck the berg head on , only one compartment would 've been flooded . I thought I could avoid hitting the berg altogether , sir . And not only did you stop your engines , you reversed them ! She would 've turned much more quickly the greater her forward motion !"
3,4,"Yes , but the watertight doors were closed immediately after impact . The compartments behind them were sealed . These watertight bulkheads go up only to "" E "" deck . The weight of the water in the bow will pull her down by the head . This ship can 't sink . This ship has about 2 hours . The lifeboats . We have lifeboats . We must launch them at once . Get everyone off the ship . That won 't be entirely possible . Of course it 's possible ! We must begin immediately . You may recall that we have precisely the number of lifeboats required by the british board of trade -- seats for 1, 200 people . There 's over 2, 000 people board this ship . 2, 230 ... souls ! I cannot allow this . Mr. Ismay ... It was under your directive that we were traveling through an ice field at the arrogant speed of 21 knots ! I 'm the master of this vessel , and I have been too complacent ."
4,5,"Captain Smith , a general distress over the wireless should be sent immediately . Mr. Murdock . Sir . See that the passengers are roused . Mr. Lightoller , organise the crew to uncover the boats . It would be best , sir , if we didn 't give any indication to the crew or the passengers as to the seriousness of the situation . Yes , quite so . We don 't want to ... start a panic . Yes , quite -- quite so . [ steam blows ] Shut her down ! Shut down those pilots ! Shut it down right now ! The captain requests all passenger to report to the main deck at once . Now , there 's no cause for alarm . Dress warmly and please bring your life jackets . Please report to the main deck at once . [ knock on door ] Mr. Allison ! Sorry to disturb you , sir . What 's going on ? It 's impossible to get a night 's sleep ."
5,6,"What 's that noise ? What is it ? The captain requests all passengers to report to the main deck . Dress warmly . What is it ? What did he say , Hudson ? Just stay here . I 'll go up on deck and find out what 's going on . No , don 't leave us here alone ! Get ahold of yourself . I 'll come right back . But he said to get dressed . I don 't know what to do . I don 't want to wake up the babies in the middle of the night . Perhaps you should get dressed ? Oh , Hudson , then it 's true ! Alice was right ! Calm down . Just get dressed . To be on the safe side ."
6,7,"I don 't know what to put on . What should I wear ? I had on my -- my black tweed this afternoon . Warm . Just dress warm . Alice , help me ! [ steam blows ] What is that ? They 're releasing the excess pressure from the boilers . Please bring your life jackets . They 're not actually going to put us in lifeboats , are they ? No , no , but put on your life preservers just as a precautionary measure . They 're on top of your armoires . Dress was warm as you can , darling . Why , if there 's really no danger ? Just do as they ask . Put on a few layers and a warm coat . I 'll meet you upstairs in 10 minutes . Henry , what 's the truth ? I don 't know any more than you do , sir . I 'm just doing what they tell me ."
7,8,"[ sighs ] You look fagged , Evans . 18- hour shift , lad . What have you got tonight ? Oh , just the Titanic sending off a batch of messages to cape grace . Could be interesting . Do you mind if I listen for while ? Have at it . How is your morse coming ? I 've figured out the odd letters , even get the gist of it sometimes . Well , I 'll see you in the A. M. Prepare to call for assistance . We 've struck an iceberg . These are the coordinates . Yes , sir . Which I call should I send , sir ? The international call for help -- C. Q. D. come quickly . Distress . Just that . Aye , sir . Oh ! I 'd hate to be in the captain 's shoes when he tells Astor and these rich mucky- mucks they 're going to be a week late getting to New York , eh ?"
8,9,"[ sending message ] Power ran out . I 'm too tired to wind it up tonight . I 'll do it in the morning when I 've got more strength . Good night , mate . Throw the covers back . Smartly , there ! Don 't take over in folds ! This is no joke . Don 't you know what to do here ? Roll . Osa ? Is that you , Osa ? [ crying ] Come on . Follow me . We 've got to get up to the boat deck . Hey , what 's the matter with you ? Come on . What the bloody hell ? Don 't ask me questions . Ask nothing ."
9,10,"Don 't touch me . Look , Osa , I 'm trying to help you . I don 't want help from any man . I 'm not just any man . Leave me alone . I don 't know what 's happened , but you have to listen to me . You 've got to come up with me to "" A "" deck where it 's safe . CLARlNDA : My girl ? There 's Osa ! Look at this ! I knew no good would come out of you ! What have you done to her ? I found her ! I would never hurt her ! Take the children down to the common room and find your father . She 's been beaten ! And Lord knows what else ! The crew come down here helping themselves , touching the girls and saying bad words . They think we 're weak because we 're people of God . Maybe they never heard of God 's vengeance ."
10,11,"But report this to the captain , I will ! The captain don 't quite have the time right now to be hearing complaints . Now 's the moment , lad . It couldn 't be better . I can 't come now . She 's hurt . Something 's happened . I can 't get it out of her . Let her people take care of her . We have work to do , you and I. Are you , uh , coming , then , Mr. Dickie ? Get her in some warm clothes . He has a hold on you . Look , I 'll be back . Just stay with the Jacks . Stay with them until I get back . Where do we go ? What do we do ? Do you people understand anything ? Go to the common area and wait for instructions ."
11,12,"Come on ! Watch out for her . I 'll be back . You can 't count on him . Not a man like that . Oh , my girl . [ crying ] You 're locking it ? Just trying to keep things orderly . Looks like they 're loading up the lifeboats . I never imagined this in my wildest dreams . People leave their staterooms in a panic . We go in and clean up after them . But what about the people down here ? Come on ! Time is money ! This way . Hold up . Everything will be all right . Captain Smith , may I have a word with you , sir ? I 'd appreciate a true appraisal of our situation ."
12,13,"We 've been damaged ... badly . How badly ? The ship has a couple of hours . This information must not be circulated for obvious reasons . Are they any rescue ships on the way ? So far we have been unable to contact any vessel near enough to help us in time . It is imperative that we get the women and children into the lifeboats . You might want to see to Mrs. Paradine . Of course . Without delay . Mr. Park . There are lifeboats for only half of those on board . I see . Thank you for your candor . Godspeed to you , Captain . And to you , sir . We 'll see you later . [ whirring ] [ wireless transmission ] Titanic ... is that you ? Did you ever get your traffic from cape grace ? Some bloody fool is asking about our passenger mail !"
13,14,"Come at once ! We 've struck a berg . It 's a C. Q. D. We 're sinking . Tell your captain ... We 've only got an hour . [ knock on door ] What in the name of heaven ? It 's the Titanic , sir . She 's struck an iceberg . She 'll sink within an hour . Dean , turn the ship around immediately . North- northwest . Aye , Captain . Are you certain of this message ? Absolutely , sir . Folks won 't survive 20 minutes in this freezing water . Send word to Captain Smith we 're coming fast as we can . Ohh ... even at full steam , it 'll take 4 hours to reach her . Where is my husband ? Where is he ? Here , ma 'am , drink this . You have to get dressed ."
14,15,"My babies . I can 't put my babies into a lifeboat . It 's freezing . It 'll be fun ! Now we 'll get to go on a boat ! STEWARD : Everyone up on deck , ma 'am . I 'm coming ! I 'm coming as fast as I can . Did you pack the children 's things , Alice ? The nappies and the warm leggings and the baby 's milk cup and his teething ring ? Don 't be scared , Lorraine . We 'll take some sugar water , all right ? There 's no time , ma 'am ! We have to go ! I can 't ! I can 't go without my husband . I 'm not leaving without my husband . Alice ? You get Lorraine , ma 'am . We 're going to drown !"
15,16,"Wait ! We must wait for my husband ! Alice ? Come back here ! Come back here right now ! You must have the cotton for Trevor 's little ear , and you don 't have the sugar water ! Are we going to drowned , Mommy ? Oh , no . Of course not . No , it 's nothing but a drill . It 's just some kind of a drill . Oh , poor darling little girl . People , please listen to your instructions . This group will be in boat 4 , and this group will be in boat 8 . They will be ready momentarily . The important thing is to keep warm . Here . Here . Glad I grabbed these on the way up . Hey , put on that life vest ."
16,17,"It doesn 't do much for a lady 's figure , but -- hey ! No room for luggage , buster . Leave everything . I even left a wad of money rolled up in a pair of french bloomers . Hand- embroidered , but what the hell ? Darling , you look so grave . Aren 't there enough boats ? No . They 're taking women and children first as a precautionary measure . Then I 'll wait and go when you do . You have to get on with the other women . We 'll be together in a few hours . In heaven or in hell ? STEWARD : We 'll be ready in just a moment . I want to know the truth . We have about an hour before this ship sinks . I 'll take you to a lifeboat and find you later . In a few hours we 'll be having breakfast on some freighter . Is that a promise ? Now , ladies and gentlemen , would you all please line up by the door ?"
17,18,"And please keep order here . That is the main thing . MAN : Are there any more women here ? Yes , come on , ladies . Do you know what this is about ? Some minor damage . They 're just taking precautions . You ! It was that woman Alice Cleaver . She has the Allison baby . Get ahold of yourself , Mrs. Miller . She 's obviously helping them with the children . We have an emergency . Locked ! They bloody locked us up down here ! Where are all the bloody Stewards ? Go back . Go back the way we come . Everything will be all right when we get to America . Everything will be all right once you 're baptized in the Lord 's church ."
18,19,"I 'll never be baptized . Of course you will . Of course . We 'll not let an iceberg stop us . We will not . I am damaged goods . Oh , my Lord , girl . You can 't give up because some bloody bully forces himself on you . Do you think God will hold you accountable ? He tests us , in every way . Fight the good fight of faith . Do you think Clarinda Jack goes down with a whimper ? Clarinda Jack goes down with a sword . Listen ! The water 's ankle- deep in some of the cabins in the front ! Nobody tells us what to do . Aye . We laid eyes on one of the Stewards . He said an officer was coming . Where the hell is he ?"
19,20,"We 're locked up down here ! We must wait . Clarinda , play some music . We must keep calm , keep our spirits up . Show the children what courage is . # Seems like only yesterday # # I sailed from out of cork # # I wandered off from Erin 's Isle # # And landed in New York # We 've gotta keep the wood away from the fire ! Shut those dampers now ! Close the main lock ! Any response ? No . The ship seems to have stopped for the night , like we have . Well , alert me of any changes . I 'll be resting on the chart room settee . Keep a lookout . You heard the old man . He 'll want to know if she comes any closer . Just what I 've been longing to do , wake him up . Look what I found . It 's so dark down there . It looks so cold ."
20,21,"Oh , it 'll only be for a few hours . There 's ships on the way here right now . I would just feel better if we were together . So would I , but the captain was adamant , and I gave him my word . To Bolivia . We will get there , won 't we ? Next year we 'll be sitting on our Terrace in La Paz , looking down on all the red- tiled roofs , with Claire , too . There 's something I must tell you about Claire . I love her . Without even knowing her , I love her . Almost as much as I love her mother . Think of the stories we can tell her . We 'll look back on this as a ... real adventure . It 's got everything . Action ... danger ... romance . We 'll brag about this to our grandchildren . Grandma and grandpa ... were on the Titanic . [ splash ] [ splash ] STEWARD : Move it , everybody . Move it along . Come on ."
21,22,"Come on . We haven 't got all day . That 's it . Isn 't that lovely ? Music to drown by . Aye . So , what 's the happy news from the bridge ? Oh , it looks grim , Phillips . We 're sinking . They 'll start loading folks in the lifeboats soon . So , any word from the Carpathia ? They 're hours away , but still our best bet . I 'm sending out the new signal , S. O. S. Might be our last chance to use it , eh ? Yeah , right . What a sorry sight that 'll be , eh ? I mean , the classiest ship ever built towed in by a rust bucket . God . Pumps can 't see to handle it , Captain ! We need light , Chief , and power for the wireless . We 'll try , Captain !"
22,23,"Well , do what you can . Mr. Allison . Mr. Allison ? Now , don 't you be afraid . Alice is here . I ain 't going to let nothing happen to you . Not this time . Why isn 't this lifeboat being filled ? Nobody said to load the boats . See here . Get back with the other passengers ! I am the chairman of this bloody shipping line . I want these people aboard this boat immediately . What became of the boat assignments , Mr. Lowe ? Nobody ever had any boat assignments , sir . Hurry . If it is serious , we must make sure to get on a lifeboat . We 'll take this one . I 'm frightened . Stop whining and get in the boat , Lulu ."
23,24,"I 'm sorry , ma 'am , but no dogs . And women only right now , sir . What are you saying ? Nobody 's going to tell me to leave Charlie . That 's the orders , ma 'am . Your husband will have to wait behind . I 'm not talking about my husband . I 'm talking about Charlie . I 'm not going to leave my helpless little dog on a sinking ship . Come on , Lulu . You can 't let these few women go alone . You heard me . No men , no dogs . Charlie will sit right here , thank you . Please , right this way . Watch your step . Right this way . Please , watch your step . We can 't fill these boats to capacity , sir . 65 people , and they 'll buckle under the weight ."
24,25,"I say lower them half- filled . We can load more people down there from the gangways . No , no , no . Too dicey . How long do you think they would last if they went into the drink ? My God , man , that water 's 28 degrees . Better to take that risk than to kill them right off , sir . You men know how to row ? Think so , sir . Good . Then you 're in command of this boat . Stand by the aft gangway and be ready to receive more passengers . Now , are there any more ladies before this boat goes ? Me , sir . Me and my baby . Yes , yes , of course . Let one of the men hold your baby while you get in . I 'll take him . Yes , yes . Sweet baby ."
25,26,"Just till I get on the boat . I don 't want no strangers holding my boy . WOMAN : It 's only supposed to be ladies and children ! Don 't let him on ! All right , men . Let 's go . Come on . Everything will be all right , folks . [ chains pull ] [ music plays ] Sir , we 've spotted what looks like a steamer maybe 10 miles off . Splendid . Has she acknowledged you ? No , sir , not yet . Well , keep signaling . Tell her we 're the Titanic . We 're sinking . Come at once . If she 's answering , I sure enough can 't tell . Aye , she 's too far away . She can 't see us . Any response , sir ?"
26,27,"No . No response . I thought I saw something , but ... it was only her masthead light flickering . Fire some rockets . Yes , sir . Lower away ! Lower away ! If you get the hell out of the way , they 'll be able to do something . You 're not going fast enough ! If they go any faster , they 'll drown the whole lot of them ! Do you know who I am ? I don 't care if you 're the bloody prince of wales ! You move back , or I 'll knock your teeth down your throat ! Don 't you point your finger at me , young man . Couldn 't have asked for more . They sent me down here to lock up all the staterooms to prevent looting . We got enough . Haven 't even started yet . I saved the purser 's office till last . People won 't have time to get stuff out of the safe ."
27,28,"What about the people downstairs ? I told them I 'd be back . Plenty of time to be a hero , sunshine . Plenty of time . Yeah , but all hell has broke loose . They 're firing rockets . Garw ! How lovely ! The key fit perfect . Ahh . Fortune smiles . An act of God , that 's what I say . What do you say ? I say we start worrying about how to get off this damn boat . Ha ha ha ! It 's white . They 're supposed to be red for "" distress . "" It 's all we have , sir . Well ... keep firing them ... every 5 or 6 minutes . There are only 7 left in the crate ."
28,29,"Then fire them all ... until they 're gone . Yes , sir . Have a look at her now . MAN WlTH BlNOCULARS : Another rocket . How many is that now , 3 ? A ship 's not going to fire rockets at sea for nothing . Maybe they 're in some sort of distress . Uh , thanks , mate . So kind of you . [ telephone rings ] What do you want ? It 's groves , sir . That 's ship 's firing rockets . 3 so far . Are they ... private signals ? He 's asking if they 're private signals . Fisherman 's flares ? No . Just tell him the rockets are white . Uh , Captain , all we know is the rockets are white . Try the lamp again ."
29,30,"If you get a reply , let me know . Sir . Get your coats . We have to hurry . Trevor -- she took Trevor . Alice took him . What ? She 's crazy . You knew it , and you let her stay . Bess , stop . Stop right now . Where did they go ? Where did she take him ? How should I know ? She ran out into the hall and all those people , and I couldn 't leave Lorraine , and I didn 't know where you were . You just left us ! You let her take the baby ? She grabbed him ! I couldn 't stop her . You weren 't here ."
30,31,"It 's not my fault . We don 't have time for this . Get your coats and go up to the boat deck . Where are you going ? I 'm going to find Trevor . I 'll meet you up on the boat deck . Bess , you have to be strong now . We both must be strong . Our baby . I 'll find him . I swear to God , I 'll find him . All right , Lorraine , come on . Come on . Come on . Everything will be all right , Mommy . Don 't worry . Oh . Oh . [ alarm sounds ] Chief , we 're going to lose another generator . Well , cut them all ."
31,32,"Right , sir . Stop the fans , anything non- essential . At all costs , lads , we 've got to keep the lights and the Marconi going . [ glass shatters ] Carry on , lads ! Keep the water out of that boiler ! Full wide open ! Out of the question . Lock the guns back in the safe . I can 't have you shooting my passengers . You 'd rather they 'd drown ? That 's quite enough , sir . We 've too few men to control a mob , should it come to that . Just -- just keep in mind that a number of our passengers are very influential people . Just remember that . I ... can 't be responsible . So don 't offend anyone in first class by blowing their brains out . Mr. Lightoller ... Here . Take it . That 's it ."
32,33,"That 's it . Sit down , please . Don 't be scared . These boys know what they 're doing . - OK . - That 's right . You 're going , too . - No , no , no . - come along . I 'm going -- No , take your hands off me ! Aah ! No ! Nobody tells Molly Brown what to do . You rotten scrubs . Captain Smith 's going to hear about this . - Sit down , madam . Please be still . - Oh , you shut up . Stand alongside . Be ready to take on additional passengers ."
33,34,"[ women sobbing ] My wife is in a delicate condition . May I accompany her , please ? No , sir , Mr. Astor . No man is allowed on this boat or any of the boats until the ladies are off . The number of the boat , so I can look for her later . 4 , sir . Don 't make me leave you . Nonsense . I 'll be on a later boat . Don 't worry . SAlLOR : OK , ma 'am , watch your step now . Look after her , please . All my life , Mr. Astor . All my life . SAlLOR : No , sir . Let 's go . The boy cannot go . Of course he can go . He 's only 13 . Blast ."
34,35,"No more boys . SAlLOR : Mind where you step . Here . No . Here , Sofia . Take it . You 'll need it . Ida , take your place . We 've been living together for many years . Where you go , I go . I don 't think anyone would object to an old gentleman like Mr. Strauss going with his wife . I won 't go before the other men . I will not be separated from my husband . What am I to do with you ? Ha ha ha . Will you look at this -- a diamond tiara . And it 's a beauty , too , Mr. Dickie , just like I promised . D- Down there in steerage -- What if they can 't get out in time ? They could drown . Can 't save the world , lad ."
35,36,"Not likely . How do I look ? We 'll cozy our way onto one of the boats . W- we 'll be taking spots meant for women and children . Some poor cows and their mangy kids down in steerage . They 'll never know the difference . I don 't think I could live with myself , taking a woman 's spot on the boats . Have you gone daft ? I don 't think I could live with myself if I didn 't try to help . There , take it . It 's yours . I 'm not going . Have you senses left you ? The people down there in steerage -- I can 't just leave them there . They don 't know where to go . There 's the Jacks and Osa . [ snickers ] You 're worrying about your little peach , aren 't you ? More like a sack of potatoes , if you ask me . Don 't worry . They 'll get them up here in plenty of time ."
36,37,"You can have your turn on her . Mind you , there 's been a long line of 'em before you . You dirty beggar . Aah ! Ow ! It was you ! You 're the one ! What did you do to her ? What did you do ? Unh ! She was begging for it ! No ! Aah ! Crash your skull wide open , have I the mind . But I 've got more important things to do . You 're a dead duck , anyway , laddie . Aah ! Give it up , boy ! You 're going down with the ship . [ groaning ] Well ... in that case , I ain 't going to be needing no tiara !"
37,38,"Save yourself , boy . Save yourself ! JAMlE : Hey , out of my way . Are the women and kids still here ? Aye . They come and took a group of 25 . They said they were coming back for more , but we all want to go now . Hey , get your flock . Follow me . Excuse me . Excuse me . Hey , we have to hurry , get you out of here . It 's too late . No . They 're still loading women and kids . You went with him . Yes , but I came back . Look , I told you , I can change . And I 'm here now . I don 't want to live anymore ."
38,39,"What happened to your faith ? Your courage ? There is no God . I look for him , and there is no God . I never felt like this about nobody in my whole life . There has to be a God . He brought you to me . Come on . Excuse us . Hey , excuse me . Please , let us through . I can 't open the gate without orders . My God , man , I 've got to get this woman on a boat . Look at her . She 's been hurt . All right , women and children . Go with the sailors . Go ... now while you 've got a chance . I 'll find you . How ?"

47,48,"That 's the way it is in times such as these . I release you . Abandon your cabin . Save yourselves . Right away , sir . He 's right , Phillips . The power 's almost gone . Phillips , you 're talking to yourself , mate . Guess we 'll get to see a big part of the world tonight , eh ? They say it 's 3/ 4 water . Hey ! Blimey ! You 've killed him . Well , he didn 't deserve to die like a sailor . Come on . Mr. Lightoller , let 's get these people on quickly , please . Where do you think you 're going ? Where 's our boat at ? You can 't come up here . This boat is full ."
48,49,"What about the rest of these lads ? - This boat is full . Now get back . - Sod that ! I 'll shoot the next man who moves . Damn you . Well , gentlemen ... I suppose it 's every man for himself . Mr. Murdock ! Oh , my God ... Why have you deserted us ? Open the bloody gates ! I told you , first class only . This way . SAlLOR : Man the lifeboats . That 's all , gentlemen . You 've done yourselves proud . MAN : Stay with me . Stay with me . Be british ! Men !"
49,50,"Be ... british . Captain , you have to help us . We must have this ship completely searched . We 've lost our baby . You 're still here ? My wife refuses to leave the ship until we find our son . Well , what about this child ? I 'm going on a lifeboat . I 'm going to see to that now . I 'll get her into a boat with a responsible person . There are no boats . Oh , my God ! My babies ! There has to be something , a collapsible . You have to help us . Gods , Captain , please help us . I 'm sorry . There 's nothing I can do . [ sobbing ] Doctor , have some of the mates bring a dozen heavy deck chairs below . Equip them with heavy bindings ."
50,51,"We may have a few hysterics with which to contend . And see to getting some ice and canvas bags . Put them in the cargo bay , for the dead . Iceberg ahead . Port around 10 degrees . Maintain your speed . Porting 10 degrees . Eyes ahead , lads . We 'll do neither the Titanic nor ourselves any good if we succumb to her same fate . Perhaps it would be prudent to stop . We do not have the luxury of prudence . Cut off all heat and hot water . Route every ounce of steam into the engines . We must go faster . Aye , sir . SAlLOR : Stay clear . That 's the way . They told us to wait near the ship for survivors . When the ship goes down , she 'll take everything with her . All those people ."
51,52,"The Jacks . We still have room on this boat . Trust me , ma 'am , we 'll go back , all right ? We just have to wait a bit until things calm down . There are going to be hundreds of people trying to get on this little boat . We 'll end up saving nobody . We can 't leave all those people . [ people screaming ] God be with you ! Will you not try and save yourself , sir ? There is a line of oftern quoted in the newspapers -- "" God himself ... cannot sink this ship . "" But ... she was appropriately named . The titans dared to challenge the gods , and for their arrogance ... they were cast down ... into hell . Forgive me . [ explosion ] Papa , where 's our boat ? We will ask the man that very thing now , won 't we ? It 's frightfully cold . Now , we must keep buttoned up and stay close together . What have I done ? It is a cruel joke ... to have left our lives in Dorchester ... for this . We 've never shrunk from danger or hardship ."
52,53,"We 've always met it head on . You 're a good man , Black Billy Jack . You 're honest . You 're hardworking as the day is long . And you can be tender , too , and I love you for it . Look . Have you even seen so many stars ? GlRL : Must be a million . A billion trillion . Look , love . Our father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come , they will be done , on Earth as it is in heaven . Ma ! Pa ! Ma ! Pa ! [ wailing ] [ screaming ] Now . We must go back now , before they 're all gone . Do you hear me ? Please , sir , we must go back ."
53,54,"Yes , all right . We 'll go back . Let 's go . You fools ! They 'll drag us under ! They 'll swamp us ! You ? He 's an animal ! He forced me ! She 's crazy ! Shut up ! Bitch ! LOWE : Don 't let her drown ! Leave me be ! All of you , get back in your places . And calm down now ! Get back in your places , all of you ! You 're lower than an animal . Animals wouldn 't do this to their own kind . LOWE : Do you hear me , miss ?"
54,55,"Can you hear us ? ! Sit down ! Do you see me ? Reach for the oar , ma 'am ! I said , sit down ! Arrgh ! Jack Phillips ! Wireless operator ! Anyone seen Phillips ? We 've got to paddle away before it pulls us under . Get back ! Get away ! No ! There 's no more room ! Stop ! You 'll founder us ! Stop at once ! Yes , sir , Mr. Lightoller . Keep your wits about you !"
55,56,"Now spread out ! Even the load ! Hang on , old man . [ groaning ] Who is it ? [ gasping ] Somebody in the water . They 're all around us . Take one , and you 've got 'em all . Too many here as it is . We 'll go under . Somebody ... help me here . Help me get her in the boat ! Ooh ! Me arm ! Aah ... I think it 's broke . Here . Take hold of my hand . Take hold of my hand . I 'll bring you in . Never fear ."
56,57,"I 've got you . [ straining ] [ gasping ] We made it . Just hold on . I never knew nobody good like you . Nobody in my whole damn life . But if I get through this ... Jamie Purse is gonna be a different man . Just hold on and don 't let go . [ groaning ] There 's one thing I know . I love you . You 're bloomin ' outta your head , mate . You 're bloomin ' outta your head , mate . Where is she ? Osa ! You was here , I know you was ! I could feel you . It was no dream . Ah ! Osa ! Sir ... hodo you think it happened to them ? I would not venture a guess ."
57,58,"E. J. Smith is the finest master in these waters . Maybe nobody can master the sea . CREWMAN : Ice ahead ! Take us around at my direction . Aye , sir ! At your direction . How long can they last in that cold water ? Not long . A few minutes , perhaps . An easy death . I don 't know if there is such a thing . Over there ! I think I hear someone . Where ? It 's too late . They 're all dead . We came too late . Everyone , carefully lean your weight to counter the swell . Keep it balanced and stay alert . Sir ... another 's died over here ."
58,59,"Can we ... can we push him off the make too , sir ? Can you see who it is ? The bloke from the wireless , sir . Phillips , isn 't it ? He only wanted to see the world , sir . Cover him with something ... and see if you can 't keep him ... with us . A light ! Pipe down . Nothing but a shooting star . Bull puckey . It 's a flare . Look ! Another one ! It 's a ship ! - I see it . - She 's right . Come on ! Two to an oar ! I 'm not gonna die on some rotten little boat ! No quiero morir ."
59,60,"Mi familia , no quiero morir . No , honey ! Honey ! Calm down . Calm down . Calm down . Listen , there 's help comin ' . There 's a ship not far from here . They didn 't spot the bloody rockets . Do you think they 'll see small boats low in the water ? So we 'll row to them , won 't we , ladies ? Come on , two to an oar . You sit here . Hey , you 're a strong cuss . You can surely help . Come on . [ shivering ] T- t- too cold . Can 't move . Oh , you 're tremblin ' like an aspen . Here ."
60,61,"Take this . I 'll have none of this . Sit back down again . I 'm in charge here . Blasted female ! Any closer , and I 'll toss you overboard . [ women murmuring ] Now come on . On the beat . 1 ... 2 ... 1 ... 2 ... They don 't see us . Well , let 's make them see us ! Come on ! Wave those lanterns around ! Find some towels or some blankets . We can put them on the oars , and we can set those ablaze . And , people , shout ! Shout as loud as you possibly can ! Come on ! We 're over here ! [ all shouting ] Come on !"
61,62,"Come on ! - We 're over here ! - We 're over here ! MAN : Sit still . Sit still ! MAN 2 : Look to the slack on the line ! MAN 3 : Pull ! [ sobbing ] This is your baby , ma 'am ? Of course . What do you think ? What is your name ? Uh , Jane . Ah ... Jane Andrews , is it ? And me baby . Right . I 'm Ismay . I 'm ... Ismay . This is the R. M. S. Carpathia . I 'm Captain Arthur Rostrand . Fifth Officer Lowe , sir ."
62,63,"[ clears throat ] My ... ship foundered at 2 : 40 this a . m . we struck an icebergs at 11 : 40 . How many people were left aboard ? Hundreds . Hundreds . Perhaps a thousand . Perhaps more . [ sobs ] They 've all gone down with her , sir . Do you understand ? They 're just gone . Go below , lad . Get yourself warm . Yes , sir . I 'm Ismay . Yes , sir . The crew will take you below , get you some soup , something hot to drink . I do not want anything . Please -- I 'd be much happier if you just left me alone . Get me to a room ... where I can be quiet ."
63,64,"I wish you would . Mr. Stevenson . Take Mr. Ismay to my quarters . Is he ... alive ? I don 't know . Could it be ... my husband ? This is Wynn Park . Mr. Wynn Park . He needs some dry clothes , um , a blanket , um ... and something hot to drink , some soup or ... He needs a doctor . Is there a doctor ? Isabella ... Oh ... darling ... You 're so cold . You 're so cold . He needs to see a doctor immediately . Will somebody please get me a doctor ? He 's -- he 's an excellent swimmer . He said he 'd get to me no matter what happened , and he did . Madam ... I 'm afraid -- Please . Don 't say anything , because I don 't want to hear it ."
64,65,"We 're going to La Paz . We 're going to sit on our Terrace and look down on the red- tiled roofs . Wynn ... just breathe , darling . Just show them you can breathe , darling . Just breathe . Just -- just breathe a little bit . Just -- just breathe . Please , ma 'am , let me help you . No ! Please let me go . He needs me . Isabella ... There 's nothing you can do , anybody can do . Mr Park is ... gone . He 's gone . Then everything is gone . Everything . Oh , my darling . Oh ... [ sobs ] We won 't find anyone still alive out there . Plot a course for New York ."
65,66,"The women on deck , have the crew take them below . As soon as we depart , they 're going to realize they 're widows . Yes , sir . Please go to the captain . Tell him the ship can 't leave yet . Madam -- You don 't understand . My husband is still out there . He -- he may be on a raft , trying to get to us . Mrs. Astor , we 've searched the water . There are no more survivors . I 'm sorry . Isabella ... MRS. FOLEY : $300, 000 ... in securities . My entire paris wardrobe . 12 pairs of shoes , good shoes . 2 ... 3 ... Your dog ? ! Don 't give me that look . He sat on my lap . And Mr. Foley ?"
66,67,"Whose lap did he sit on ? How many people were in your boat ? How many people ? ! 20 ! 30 ! I don 't know . We had no room . There was room for 65 . I lost everything , too . Look at me ! I am a sight . Not even any ... face powder . What about you ? A healthy young man like you , whose seat did you take ? It was an accident . I -- I fell ... from the davit . How convenient . It 's true ! God knows I don 't deserve to be here ."
67,68,"I 'd give my life to save one of them lost . I 'm sorry . I don 't deserve to be here either . Excuse me . Have you seen this girl -- E- excuse me . I 'm looking for this -- I- I 'm looking for this girl . Osa Ludwigsen . Danish . A- and the Jack family . Have you seen any of 'em ? I- I 'm looking for this girl , long blond hair . I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . Osa ! I 've been looking -- you 're all right ! I wouldn 't have left him if I 'd known there weren 't enough boats . I , uh -- excuse me , ma 'am . I -- I thought you were somebody else . I 'm sorry , ma 'am . I -- He was wearing a red hat ... Oh !"
68,69,"Doc wants to take me leg . Says it 's frostbite . Not gonna left him , though . I 'm not about to lose her , eh ? No , eh ? I just gotta keep it moving . MOLLY BROWN : Hey ! Hey , can you give me a hand here ? Yoo- hoo ! Over here ! Yes , ma 'am . Gotta get some soup into this gal , or she 's never gonna make it . Here . Come on . Hold her up for me ? Osa ... is it you ? It -- it happened , didn 't it ? You came to me in the lifeboat . I was tryin ' to keep you from fallin ' back in the water , but I closed my eyes for a second , and when I opened 'em , you was gone . Honey , you was dreamin ' ."
69,70,"She was pushed out of the boat . Mrs. Paradine and Officer Lowe pulled her out of the drink . Jamie . It 's a miracle . Is there a God after all ? Yes , and he wants you to drink this soup . Here . You got to get some nourishment . Go on . The Jacks ? I haven 't found them yet . Not even the children ? Not even the children . All those people ... they 're gone . Good people . And look at me . A common thief . Why am I still here ? What kind of God would permit that ? What 's the reason ?"
70,71,"Maybe there is not such a thing as a reason . Accept it ... the gift . A chance to start over . We know that there 's hell ... so could there be heaven ? Mrs. Paradine , you must come down below . It 's cold . The ocean 's so big , isn 't it ? And it makes one feel so small , so , uh ... insignificant . Maybe it 's just to remind us that someday ... someday we 'll all die . Yes . A ship of widows . It 's good , ma 'am , that we don 't know how things is gonna end in the beginning , or we 'd never make the journeys that we were meant to take in this life . The journeys that ... Make us who we are . You 're a good way , Officer Lowe . I guess ... what I want to say is that I -- I think you 're a good sailor . And I thank you . [ ship 's horn blows ] Look this way , please ! Mrs. Brown , over here . Oh . Mrs. Brown , you came through ."
71,72,"Well , the Titanic wasn 't unsinkable , but I am . How do you feel about the white star line ? In Leadville , Colorado , where I come from , Mr. Ismay would be hung up on the nearest pine tree . Did you lose much ? Everything I own 's at the bottom of the sea , but don 't mention it . The real shame is those lifeboats left half- empty ! Mrs. Brown , what are your plans ? I 'm thinkin ' of running ' for the senate . Hell , I survived this . I could survive politics . [ reporters chuckle ] It 's clear that John 's sons won 't be coming for me . Of course they will . So many people out there . What about you , Isabella ? Eddie will come , won 't he , in spite of the wireless ? No . No . He 's a very proud man . I was going to set the world straight ... and I only succeeded in hurting two more people . My husband and my little girl ."
72,73,"He 'll let you see Claire , won 't he ? I don 't want to think about that . I guess I 'm at his mercy . I recognized her from the picture I 'd seen in the London newspaper . Alice , now , we know who you are . Give the baby to Mr. allison 's brother here . They 'll take good care of him . I saved him . Yes , you did , but he 's not your child . Come on , now . This way ! This way ! Alice , you risked your life to save this baby , is that right ? I risked my life . Alice , we understand what you 've been through , but can you give us a little smile ? For the camera , Alice . A pretty girl like you ? You 're a real hero , Alice . Am I ? Your courageous story 's gonna be in papers all over the country ."
73,74,"Is that so ? Do you have anything to say to the people of America ? His mother , she give him to me . She knows that a strong girl I am . And the ship was going down , and there was walls of water rushing down the hallway . And she knows she can ... trust me to keep him safe . I saved him . They 're here . John 's sons , I can see them . They 're here to meet me after all . It will be all right , Madeleine . I know it will . Thank you , Isabella ... for giving me for this . Goodbye , Madeleine . Heh . No more sea voyages for me . I figure I beat the odds this time . I 'm not gonna be testing fate again . Are you still going to Californy ? Actually ..."
74,75,"I was thinking about , uh ... Minnesota . I don 't know maybe I should join the church . I don 't think you 'd really like that . I just want to be with you . Start a life with you , a better life . Maybe it 's waiting for us in Californy . No , no . Osa , I don 't want you givin ' up your dream . Well , you have a dream , too . About pictures in a box ? They have nurses and teachers in Californy . Peach trees , too . And oranges . Oranges as big as grapefruits . And we 'll grow 'em in our own backyard . And I 'll pick one for you every morning for breakfast . How 's that ? GlRL : Mama ! Mama ! Over here !"
75,76,"Mama ! Mama ! Excuse me . Oh ! - Oh ! - Mama ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my baby . Oh , my God . Oh , my beautiful little girl . I love you . Ohh ! Thank God you 're home safe . Thank God ! Eddie ... Eddie , the wireless ... I 'm -- I 'm sorry . What wireless ? I -- I sent you a wireless ? I have to explain . I never got any wireless ."
76,77,"Anyway , it doesn 't matter . Nothing else matters except ... you 're home . Yes , you 're right . I 'm home ."
