170,a170,b170,They stood united against what they viewed as the threat posed by unruly plebeians.,"After the riots, however, scientist and clergyman Joseph Priestley argued in his An Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the Birmingham Riots (1791) that this cooperation had not in fact been as amicable as generally believed.",1
171,a171,b171,"Priestley revealed that disputes over the local library, Sunday Schools, and church attendance had divided Dissenters from Anglicans.","In his Narrative of the Riots in Birmingham (1816), stationer and Birmingham historian William Hutton agreed, arguing that five events stoked the fires of religious friction: disagreements over inclusion of Priestley's books in the local public library; concerns over Dissenters' attempts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts; religious controversy (particularly involving Priestley); an ""inflammatory hand-bill""; and a dinner celebrating the outbreak of the French Revolution.Once Birmingham Dissenters started to agitate for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted Dissenters' civil rights (preventing them, for instance, from attending the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or from holding public office), the semblance of unity among the town's elite disappeared.",1

179,a179,b179,"Writing shortly after the event, Priestley described the first part of the attack, which he witnessed from a distance:It being remarkably calm, and clear moon-light, we could see to a considerable distance, and being upon a rising ground, we distinctly heard all that passed at the house, every shout of the mob, and almost every stroke of the instruments they had provided for breaking the doors and the furniture.","For they could not get any fire, though one of them was heard to offer two guineas for a lighted candle; my son, whom we left behind us, having taken the precaution to put out all the fires in the house, and others of my friends got all the neighbours to do the same.",1

234,a234,b234,"Stung by criticism of their 1988 release, Rattle and Hum, U2 shifted their musical direction to incorporate influences from alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music into their sound.","Thematically, Achtung Baby is darker, more introspective, and at times more flippant than their previous work.",1
235,a235,b235,"The album and the subsequent multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour were central to the group's 1990s reinvention, by which they abandoned their earnest public image for a more lighthearted and self-deprecating one.Seeking inspiration from German reunification, U2 began recording Achtung Baby at Berlin's Hansa Studios in October 1990.","The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material.",1
236,a236,b236,"After tensions and slow progress nearly prompted the group to disband, they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song ""One"".","Morale and productivity improved during subsequent recording sessions in Dublin, where the album was completed in 1991.",1
237,a237,b237,"To confound the public's expectations of the band and their music, U2 chose the record's facetious title and colourful multi-image sleeve.Achtung Baby is one of U2's most successful records; it received favourable reviews and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 Top Albums, while topping the charts in many other countries.","Five songs were released as commercial singles, all of which were chart successes, including ""One"", ""Mysterious Ways"", and ""The Fly"".",1
238,a238,b238,The album has sold 18 million copies worldwide and won a Grammy Award in 1993 for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.,Achtung Baby has since been acclaimed by writers and music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time.,1
239,a239,b239,"The record was reissued in October 2011 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of its original release.After U2's 1987 album The Joshua Tree and the supporting Joshua Tree Tour brought them critical acclaim and commercial success,Despite their commercial popularity, the group were dissatisfied creatively; lead vocalist Bono believed they were musically unprepared for their success, while drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, ""We were the biggest, but we weren't the best.","""Reacting to their own sense of musical stagnation and to their critics, U2 searched for new musical ground.In mid-1990, Bono reviewed material he had written in Australia on the Lovetown Tour, and the group recorded demos at STS Studios in Dublin.",1
240,a240,b240,"—Brian Eno, on Achtung BabyU2 hired Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno to produce the album, based on the duo's prior work with the band on The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree.The band believed that ""domesticity Morale worsened once the sessions commenced, as the band worked long days but could not agree on a musical direction.","—The Edge, on the recording of ""One""U2 found that they were neither prepared nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs.U2 returned to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group.",1
241,a241,b241,"Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded better than they originally thought.In February 1991, U2 moved the album's recording sessions to the seaside manor Elsinore in the Dublin suburb of Dalkey, renting the house for ₤10,000 per month.","The band struggled with one particular song—later released as the B-side ""Lady With the Spinning Head""—but three separate tracks, ""The Fly"", ""Ultraviolet (Light My Way)"" and ""Zoo Station"", were derived from it.In April, tapes from the earlier Berlin sessions were stolen after the band reportedly left them in a hotel room, and they were subsequently leaked before the album was finished.Staffing schedules led to the band having a surplus of engineers at one point, and as a result, they split recording between Elsinore and the Edge's home studio to increase productivity.During the Dublin sessions, Eno was sent tapes of the previous two months' work, which he called a ""total disaster"".",1
242,a242,b242,"Joining U2 in the studio, he stripped away what he thought to be excessive overdubbing.","The group believes his intervention saved the album.After work at Elsinore finished in July, the sessions moved to Windmill Lane Studios where Eno, Flood, Lanois, and previous U2 producer Steve Lillywhite mixed the tracks.",1
243,a243,b243,"—The Edge, explaining the band's motivation for seeking a new soundU2 is credited with composing the music for all of Achtung Baby's tracks,For the album, the Edge often eschewed his normally minimalistic approach to guitar playing and his trademark chiming, delay-heavy sound, in favour of a style that incorporated more solos, dissonance, and feedback.The rhythm section is more pronounced in the mix on Achtung Baby,Whereas Bono exhibited a full-throated vocal delivery on the group's previous releases, for Achtung Baby he extended his range into a lower register and used what Fast described as ""breathy and subdued colors"".As is often the case on U2 albums, Bono is credited as the sole lyricist.","Central to these themes was the Edge's separation from his wife (the mother of his three children), which occurred halfway through the album's recording.",1
244,a244,b244,"The pain not only focused him on the record and led him to advocate more personal themes, but it also affected Bono's lyrical contributions.Of the album's personal nature, Bono said that there were a lot of ""blood and guts"" in it.","Similarly, ""Ultraviolet (Light My Way)"" describes a strained relationship and unease over obligations,U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono's habit of keeping his lyrics ""in flux until the last minute"" with providing a narrative coherence to the album.",1
245,a245,b245,"For Flanagan, ""Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World"" on the album's latter third describes the character stumbling home in a drunken state, and the final three songs—""Ultraviolet (Light My Way)"", ""Acrobat"", and ""Love Is Blindness""—are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other.Despite the record's darker themes, many lyrics are more flippant and sexual than those from the band's previous work.","""Trashy"" and ""throwaway"" were among the band's buzzwords during recording, leading to many tracks in this vein.",1
246,a246,b246,"The chorus of ""Ultraviolet (Light My Way)"" features the pop lyrical cliché ""baby, baby, baby"",Religious imagery is present throughout the record.","""Until the End of the World"" is an imagined conversation between Jesus Christ and his betrayer, Judas Iscariot.",1
247,a247,b247,"—Mat Snow, contrasting the title and artwork of Achtung Baby with U2's previous albumsThe sleeve artwork for Achtung Baby was designed by Steve Averill, who had created the majority of U2's album covers, along with Shaughn McGrath.An initial photo shoot with the band's long-time photographer Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990.Several photographs were considered as candidates for a single cover image, including shots of: a cow on an Irish farm in County Kildare; the nude Clayton; and the band driving a Trabant, an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe.The German word ""Achtung"" (IPA: ) in the album title translates into English as ""attention"" or ""watch out"".U2 considered several other  titles for the album, including Man (in contrast to the group's debut, Boy),As early as December 1990, the music press reported that U2 would be recording a dance-oriented album and that it would be released in mid-1991.Island Records and U2 refused to make advance copies of the album available to the press until just a few days before the release date, preferring that fans listen to the record before reading reviews.","The decision came amid rumours of tensions within the band, and journalist David Browne compared it to the Hollywood practice of withholding pre-release copies of films from reviewers whenever they receive poor word-of-mouth press.Achtung Baby was U2's first album in three years and their first comprising entirely new material in over four years.",1

251,a251,b251,"and it earned Lanois and Eno the award for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical).Following the release of Achtung Baby, U2 staged a worldwide concert tour, titled the Zoo TV Tour.","Like Achtung Baby, the tour was intended to deviate from the band's past.",1
252,a252,b252,"In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborately staged multimedia event.Whereas the group were known for their earnest live act in the 1980s, their Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating;The tour began in February 1992 and comprised 157 shows over almost two years.","—AJ Ramirez of PopMatters, in 2011Achtung Baby is certified 8× platinum in the US by the RIAA,The record is highly regarded among the members of U2.",1

343,a343,b343,"First named Agaricus palmatus by Bulliard in 1785, it was reclassified into several different genera before becoming Rhodotus in 1926.","The familial placement of the genus Rhodotus within the order Agaricales has also been subject to dispute, and the taxon has been transferred variously to the families Amanitaceae, Entolomataceae, and Tricholomataceae.",1
344,a344,b344,"More recently, molecular phylogenetics analysis has helped determine that Rhodotus is most closely related to genera in the Physalacriaceae.The type species of genus Rhodotus was originally described as Agaricus palmatus in 1785 by French botanist Jean Bulliard;French botanist Claude Gillet called the species Pleurotus subpalmatus in 1876.","According to the same publication, another synonym is Lentinula reticeps, described by William Alphonso Murrill in 1915, who thought it to be synonymous with Agaricus reticeps (described by Montagne in 1856), Agaricus reticulatus (Johnson, 1880), Agaricus alveolatus (Cragin, 1885), Pluteus alveolatus (Saccardo, 1887), and Panus meruliiceps (Peck, 1905).The placement of the genus Rhodotus in the order Agaricales is uncertain, and various authors have offered solutions to the taxonomic conundrum.",1
345,a345,b345,"In 1951, Agaricales specialist Rolf Singer placed Rhodotus in the Amanitaceae because of similarities between the tribes Amaniteae and Rhodoteae, such as spore color and ornamentation (modifications of the spore wall that result in surface irregularities), structure of the hyphae and trama, and chlamydospore production during culture growth.In 1953, French mycologists  Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi placed Rhodotus in the family Tricholomataceae—a traditional ""wastebasket taxon""—on the basis of spore color.The use of molecular phylogenetics has helped to clarify the proper taxonomic placement of Rhodotus.",Studies of the ribosomal DNA sequences from a wide variety of agaric fungi have corroborated Kühner and Romagnesi's placement of Rhodotus in the Tricholomataceae as then understood.,1
346,a346,b346,"A large scale phylogenetic analysis published in 2005 showed Rhodotus to be in the ""core euagarics clade"", a name given to a grouping of gilled mushrooms corresponding largely to the suborder Agaricineae as defined by Singer (1986), but also including taxa that were traditionally classified in the Aphyllophorales (e.g., Clavaria, Typhula, Fistulina, Schizophyllum, etc.)","and several orders of Gasteromycetes (e.g., Hymenogastrales, Lycoperdales, Nidulariales).The fruit body of Rhodotus has a cap, and stem without a ring or volva.",1
347,a347,b347,"The cap initially assumes a convex shape before flattening somewhat with age, and typically reaches widths of 2–6 centimeters (0.8–2.4 in).The gills have an adnate attachment to the stem, that is, broadly attached to the stem along all or most of the gill width.","The gills are thick, packed close to each other, with veins and color similar to, but paler than, the cap.",1

377,a377,b377,"The trebuchet is 18 metres (59 ft) tall, made from over 300 pieces of oak and weighs 22 tonnes (24 short tons).","It sits on the riverbank below the castle.The machine was built with drawings from the Danish living history museum Middelaldercentret, who, in 1989, were the first to recreate a fully functioning trebuchet.The trebuchet takes eight men half an hour to load and release.",1
378,a378,b378,"The process involves four men running in 4 metres (13 ft) tall treadwheels to lift the counterweight, weighing 6 tonnes (7 short tons), into the air.","It is designed to be capable of hurling projectiles of up to 150 kilograms (330 lb) distances of up to 300 metres (980 ft) and as high as 25 metres (82 ft).On 21 August 2006, the trebuchet claimed the record as the most powerful siege engine of its type when it sent a projectile weighing 13 kilograms (29 lb) a distance of 249 metres (817 ft) at a speed of 195 kilometres per hour (121 mph), beating the previous record held by the trebuchet at Middelaldercentret in Denmark.On 10 April 2015 a thatched boathouse caught fire shortly after a burning cannonball was fired by the trebuchet.Other tourist attractions include ""Flight of the Eagles'"" (a bird show, featuring bald eagles, vultures, and sea eagles),At times during Summer 2018, the castle offered its War of the Roses event with jousting and other action.",1
379,a379,b379,"On certain dates in August, Dragon Slayer evenings were scheduled, with dining, a projection light show, pyrotechnics, fire jousting and live action stunts.The current castle, built in stone during the reign of King Henry II, is on the same site as the earlier Norman motte-and-bailey castle.","A keep used to stand on the motte which is on the south west of the site, although most of the structure now dates from the post-medieval period.When Warwick Castle was rebuilt in the reign of King Henry II it had a new layout with the buildings against the curtain walls.",1
380,a380,b380,"The castle is surrounded by a dry moat on the northern side where there is no protection from the river or the old motte; the perimeter of the walls is 130 metres (140 yd) long by 82 metres (90 yd) wide.Over its 950 years of history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 different individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs.","It was the family seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, and has been a family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families.",1
381,a381,b381,"The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three times had a woman (or girl) as the owner.","Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three.",1
382,a382,b382,"At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered.",Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.Formal gardens belonging to Warwick Castle were first recorded in 1534.,1
383,a383,b383,"Francis Greville commissioned Lancelot Brown to re-landscape the castle grounds; he began working on the grounds and park in 1749 and had completed his work by 1757, having spent about £2,293 (£300 thousand as of 2019).","The gardens cover 2.8 square kilometres (690 acres).A water-powered mill in the castle grounds was probably built under Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick.",1

385,a385,b385,"The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of the English city of London from Sunday, 2 September to Thursday, 6 September 1666.The death toll is unknown but was traditionally thought to have been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded.","This reasoning has recently been challenged on the grounds that the deaths of poor and middle-class people were not recorded; moreover, the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims, leaving no recognisable remains.",1
386,a386,b386,"A melted piece of pottery on display at the Museum of London found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where the fire started, shows that the temperature reached 1,250 °C (2,280 °F; 1,520 K).The Great Fire started at the bakery (or baker's house) of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September, and spread rapidly west across the City of London.",The major firefighting technique of the time was to create firebreaks by means of demolition; this was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth.,1
387,a387,b387,"By the time large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm that defeated such measures.",The fire pushed north on Monday into the heart of the City.Order in the streets broke down as rumours arose of suspicious foreigners setting fires.,1
388,a388,b388,"The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence.","On Tuesday, the fire spread over most of the City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten King Charles II's court at Whitehall.",1
389,a389,b389,"Coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising; the battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.The social and economic problems created by the disaster were overwhelming.","Evacuation from London and resettlement elsewhere were strongly encouraged by Charles II, who feared a London rebellion amongst the dispossessed refugees.",1
390,a390,b390,"Despite several radical proposals, London was reconstructed on essentially the same street plan used before the fire.By the 1660s, London was by far the largest city in Britain, estimated at half a million inhabitants.","However, due to the Great Plague of London during the last winter, its population was lower than before it.",1
391,a391,b391,"John Evelyn, contrasting London to the Baroque magnificence of Paris, called it a ""wooden, northern, and inartificial congestion of Houses"", and expressed alarm about the fire hazards posed by the wood and the congestion.London had been a Roman settlement for four centuries and had become progressively more crowded inside its defensive city wall.","It had also pushed outwards beyond the wall into squalid extramural slums such as Shoreditch, Holborn, and Southwark, and had reached far enough to include the independent City of Westminster.By the late 17th century, the City proper—the area bounded by the City wall and the River Thames—was only a part of London, covering some 700 acres (2.8 km2; 1.1 sq mi),The aristocracy shunned the City and lived either in the countryside beyond the slum suburbs, or in the exclusive Westminster district (the modern West End), the site of King Charles II's court at Whitehall.",1
392,a392,b392,"Wealthy people preferred to live at a convenient distance from the traffic-clogged, polluted, unhealthy City, especially after it was hit by a devastating outbreak of bubonic plague in the Plague Year of 1665.The relationship was often tense between the City and the Crown.","The City of London had been a stronghold of republicanism during the Civil War (1642–1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still had the potential to be a threat to Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the early 1660s.",1
393,a393,b393,"The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and could remember how Charles I's grab for absolute power had led to that national trauma.They were determined to thwart any similar tendencies in his son, and when the Great Fire threatened the City, they refused the offers that Charles made of soldiers and other resources.","Even in such an emergency, the idea of having the unpopular Royal troops ordered into the City was political dynamite.",1
394,a394,b394,"By the time that Charles took over command from the ineffectual Lord Mayor, the fire was already out of control.The City was essentially medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren of narrow, winding, cobbled alleys.","It had experienced several major fires before 1666, the most recent in 1632.",1
395,a395,b395,"Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used.","The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose every inch of building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population.",1
396,a396,b396,"These parishes contained workplaces, many of which were fire hazards—foundries, smithies, glaziers—which were technically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.The human habitations were crowded to bursting point, intermingled with these sources of heat, sparks, and pollution, and their construction increased the fire risk.","The typical six- or seven-storey timbered London tenement houses had ""jetties"" (projecting upper floors).",1
397,a397,b397,"They had a narrow footprint at ground level, but maximised their use of land by ""encroaching"" on the street, as a contemporary observer put it, with the gradually increasing size of their upper storeys.","The fire hazard was well perceived when the top jetties all but met across the narrow alleys; ""as it does facilitate a conflagration, so does it also hinder the remedy"", wrote one observer of Magistrates"" worked in favour of jetties.",1
398,a398,b398,"In 1661, Charles II issued a proclamation forbidding overhanging windows and jetties, but this was largely ignored by the local government.","Charles's next, sharper message in 1665 warned of the risk of fire from the narrowness of the streets and authorised both imprisonment of recalcitrant builders and demolition of dangerous buildings.",1
399,a399,b399,"It, too, had little impact.Wattle-and-daub was a common building material: research by fire brigades showed that well-made new wattle-and-daub is strongly fire-resistant, but old neglected wattle-and-daub with patches of daub flaked off exposing patched of wattle catches fire readily.The river front was important in the development of the Great Fire.","The Thames offered water for firefighting and the chance of escape by boat, but the poorer districts along the riverfront had stores and cellars of combustibles which increased the fire risk.",1
400,a400,b400,"All along the wharves, the rickety wooden tenements and tar paper shacks of the poor were shoehorned amongst ""old paper buildings and the most combustible matter of tarr, pitch, hemp, rosen, and flax which was all layd up thereabouts.","""London was also full of black powder, especially along the river front.",1
401,a401,b401,"Much of it was left in the homes of private citizens from the days of the English Civil War, as the former members of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army still retained their muskets and the powder with which to load them.",Five to six hundred tons of powder was stored in the Tower of London.,1
402,a402,b402,"The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels.Fires were common in the crowded wood-built city with its open fireplaces, candles, ovens, and stores of combustibles.","There was no police or fire brigade to call, but London's local militia, known as the Trained Bands, was available for general emergencies, at least in principle, and watching for fire was one of the jobs of the watch, a thousand watchmen or ""bellmen"" who patrolled the streets at night.",1
403,a403,b403,"Self-reliant community procedures were in place for dealing with fires, and they were usually effective.","Public-spirited citizens would be alerted to a dangerous house fire by muffled peals on the church bells, and would congregate hastily to fight the fire.The methods available for this relied on demolition and water.",1
404,a404,b404,"By law, the tower of every parish church had to hold equipment for these efforts: long ladders, leather buckets, axes, and ""firehooks"" for pulling down buildings (see illustration right, see also pike pole).London Bridge was the only physical connection between the City and the south side of the river Thames and was itself covered with houses.","It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning.",1
405,a405,b405,Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge.The 18-foot (5.5 m) high Roman wall enclosing the City put the fleeing homeless at risk of being shut into the inferno.,"Once the riverfront was on fire and the escape route cut off by boat, the only exits were the eight gates in the wall.",1
406,a406,b406,"During the first couple of days, few people had any notion of fleeing the burning City altogether.","They would remove what they could carry of their belongings to the nearest ""safe house"", in many cases the parish church or the precincts of St Paul's Cathedral, only to have to move again hours later.",1
407,a407,b407,"Some moved their belongings and themselves ""four and five times"" in a single day.","The perception of a need to get beyond the walls took root only late on the Monday, and then there were near-panic scenes at the narrow gates as distraught refugees tried to get out with their bundles, carts, horses, and wagons.The crucial factor which frustrated firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets.",1
408,a408,b408,"Even under normal circumstances, the mix of carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and gridlock.","During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.Demolishing the houses downwind of a dangerous fire was often an effective way of containing the destruction by means of firehooks or explosives.",1
409,a409,b409,"This time, however, demolition was fatally delayed for hours by the Lord Mayor's lack of leadership and failure to give the necessary orders.","By the time that orders came directly from the King to ""spare no houses"", the fire had devoured many more houses, and the demolition workers could no longer get through the crowded streets.The use of water to extinguish the fire was also frustrated.",1
410,a410,b410,"In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington.",It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets.,1
411,a411,b411,"Further, Pudding Lane was close to the river.","Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.This did not happen, or at least was no longer happening by the time that Pepys viewed the fire from the river at mid-morning on the Sunday.",1
412,a412,b412,"Pepys comments in his diary that nobody was trying to put it out, but instead they fled from it in fear, hurrying ""to remove their goods, and leave all to the fire.""",The flames crept towards the river front with little interference from the overwhelmed community and soon torched the flammable warehouses along the wharves.,1
413,a413,b413,"The resulting conflagration cut off the firefighters from the immediate water supply from the river and set alight the water wheels under London Bridge which pumped water to the Cornhill water tower; the direct access to the river and the supply of piped water failed together.London possessed advanced fire-fighting technology in the form of fire engines, which had been used in earlier large-scale fires.","However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference.",1
414,a414,b414,"Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds.On this occasion, an unknown number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City.","The piped water had already failed which they were designed to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached.",1
415,a415,b415,"Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames.",The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.The personal experiences of many Londoners during the fire are glimpsed in letters and memoirs.,1
416,a416,b416,"The two best-known diarists of the Restoration are Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) and John Evelyn (1620–1706), and both recorded the events and their own reactions day by day, and made great efforts to keep themselves informed of what was happening all over the City and beyond.After two rainy summers in 1664 and 1665, London had lain under an exceptional drought since November 1665, and the wooden buildings were tinder-dry after the long hot summer of 1666.",A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September.,1
417,a417,b417,"The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim.","The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread.",1
418,a418,b418,"The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned, who alone had the authority to override their wishes.When Bloodworth arrived, the flames were consuming the adjoining houses and creeping towards the paper warehouses and flammable stores on the riverfront.","The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found.",1
419,a419,b419,"Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job.","He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.",1
420,a420,b420,"""Pepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret.",He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration.,1
421,a421,b421,"It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the riverfront.","The houses on London Bridge were burning.He took a boat to inspect the destruction around Pudding Lane at close range and describes a ""lamentable"" fire, ""everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another.""",1
422,a422,b422,"Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, ""where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and the word was carried into the King.","So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire.",1
423,a423,b423,"They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded me to go to my Lord Mayor from him and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way.""","Charles' brother James, Duke of York, offered the use of the Royal Life Guards to help fight the fire.Young schoolboy William Taswell had bolted from the early morning service in Westminster Abbey.",1
424,a424,b424,"He saw some refugees arrive in hired lighter boats near Westminster Stairs, a mile west of Pudding Lane, unclothed and covered only with blankets.","The services of the lightermen had suddenly become extremely expensive, and only the luckiest refugees secured a place in a boat.The fire spread quickly in the high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people abandoned attempts at extinguishing it and fled.",1
425,a425,b425,The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for firemen and carriages.,"Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but reached only St Paul's Cathedral before he had to get out and walk.",1
426,a426,b426,"Pedestrians with handcarts and goods were still on the move away from the fire, heavily weighed down.","The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which soon had to be moved further afield.Pepys found Bloodworth trying to co-ordinate the fire-fighting efforts and near to collapse, ""like a fainting woman"", crying out plaintively in response to the King's message that he was pulling down houses.",1
427,a427,b427,"""But the fire overtakes us faster then  The delay rendered these measures largely futile, as the fire was already out of control.By Sunday afternoon, 18 hours after the alarm was raised in Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging firestorm that created its own weather.","A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level.",1
428,a428,b428,"The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both north and south of the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.Pepys went again on the river in the early evening with his wife and some friends, ""and to the fire up and down, it still encreasing"".","They ordered the boatman to go ""so near the fire as we could for smoke; and all over the Thames, with one's face in the wind, you were almost burned with a shower of firedrops"".",1
429,a429,b429,"When the ""firedrops"" became unbearable, the party went on to an alehouse on the South Bank and stayed there till darkness came and they could see the fire on London Bridge and across the river, ""as only one entire arch of fire from this to the other side of the bridge, and in a bow up the hill for an arch of above a mile long: it made me weep to see it"".","Pepys described this arch of fire as ""a bow with God's arrow in it with a shining point"".The fire was principally expanding north and west by dawn on Monday, 3 September, the turbulence of the fire storm pushing the flames both farther south and farther north than the day before.",1

440,a440,b440,"The chaos at the gates was such that the magistrates ordered the gates shut on Monday afternoon, in the hope of turning the inhabitants' attention from safeguarding their own possessions to fighting the fire: ""that, no hopes of saving any things left, they might have more desperately endeavoured the quenching of the fire.""","This headlong and unsuccessful measure was rescinded the next day.Monday marked the beginning of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked.",1

447,a447,b447,"It contained the fire until late afternoon, when the flames leapt across and began to destroy the wide affluent luxury shopping street of Cheapside.Everybody had thought St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural firebreak in the form of a wide empty surrounding plaza.",It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row.,1
448,a448,b448,"However, the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by Christopher Wren, who was relatively unknown then.","The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.Leaving school, young William Taswell stood on Westminster Stairs a mile away and watched as the flames crept round the cathedral and the burning scaffolding ignited the timbered roof beams.",1
449,a449,b449,"Within half an hour, the lead roof was melting, and the books and papers in the crypt caught with a roar.","""The stones of Paul's flew like grenados,"" reported Evelyn in his diary, ""the melting lead running down the streets in a stream, and the very pavements glowing with fiery redness, so as no horse, nor man, was able to tread on them.""",1
450,a450,b450,"The cathedral was quickly a ruin.In St.Paul's, falling heavy masonry broke through into its crypt, where booksellers had stored huge stocks of books, and all were burned.During the day, the flames began to move eastward from the neighbourhood of Pudding Lane, straight against the prevailing east wind and towards Pepys's home on Seething Lane and the Tower of London with its gunpowder stores.",The garrison at the Tower took matters into their own hands after waiting all day for requested help from James's official firemen who were busy in the west.,1
451,a451,b451,"They created firebreaks by blowing up houses on a large scale in the vicinity, halting the advance of the fire.","In a letter to William Coventry, Pepys wrote that he ""saw how horribly the sky looks, all on a fire in the night, was enough to put us out of our wits; and, indeed, it was extremely dreadful, for it looks just as if it was at us, and the whole heaven on fire.",1
452,a452,b452,"""The wind dropped on Tuesday evening, and the firebreaks created by the garrison finally began to take effect on Wednesday 5 September.Pepys visited Moorfields, a large public park immediately north of the City, and saw a great encampment of homeless refugees, ""poor wretches carrying their good there, and every body keeping his goods together by themselves"".",He noted that the price of bread had doubled in the environs of the park.,1
453,a453,b453,"Evelyn also went out to Moorfields, which was turning into the main point of assembly for the homeless, and was horrified at the numbers of distressed people filling it, some under tents, others in makeshift shacks: ""Many  Evelyn was impressed by the pride of these distressed Londoners, ""tho' ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet not asking one pennie for relief.","""Fears were as high as ever among the traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion.",1
454,a454,b454,"There was an outbreak of general panic on Wednesday night in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington.","A light in the sky over Fleet Street started a story that 50,000 French and Dutch immigrants had risen, widely rumoured to have started the fire, and were marching towards Moorfields to finish what the fire had begun: to cut the men's throats, rape the women, and steal their few possessions.",1
455,a455,b455,"Surging into the streets, the frightened mob fell on any foreigners whom they happened to encounter, and were appeased, according to Evelyn, only ""with infinite pains and great difficulty"" and pushed back into the fields by the Trained Bands, troops of Life Guards, and members of the court.The mood was now so volatile that Charles feared a full-scale London rebellion against the monarchy.","Food production and distribution had been disrupted to the point of non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread would be brought into the City every day, and safe markets set up round the perimeter.",1
456,a456,b456,"These markets were for buying and selling; there was no question of distributing emergency aid.Only a few deaths from the fire are officially recorded, and deaths are traditionally believed to have been few.","Porter gives the figure as eightHanson takes issue with the idea that there were only a few deaths, enumerating known deaths from hunger and exposure among survivors of the fire, ""huddled in shacks or living among the ruins that had once been their homes"" in the cold winter that followed, including, for instance, dramatist James Shirley and his wife.",1
457,a457,b457,"Hanson also maintains that ""it stretches credulity to believe that the only papists or foreigners being beaten to death or lynched were the ones rescued by the Duke of York"", that official figures say very little about the fate of the undocumented poor, and that the heat at the heart of the firestorms was far greater than an ordinary house fire, and was enough to consume bodies fully or leave only a few skeletal fragments.The fire was fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, but also by the oil, pitch, tar, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and gunpowder stored in the riverside district.","It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480 °C (2,300 and 2,700 °F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650 °C (2,000 and 3000 °F)).",1
458,a458,b458,"Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of much interest to the hungry people sifting through the tens of thousands of tons of rubble and debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to the workmen clearing away the rubble later during the rebuilding.Hanson appeals to common sense and ""the experience of every other major urban fire down the centuries"", emphasising that the fire attacked the rotting tenements of the poor with furious speed, surely trapping at the very least ""the old, the very young, the halt and the lame"" and burying the dust and ashes of their bones under the rubble of cellars, producing a death toll not of four or eight, but of ""several hundred and quite possibly several thousand.","""The Bills of Mortality were not compiled for the period of the fire, due to the disruption caused by the fire.The material destruction has been computed at 13,500 houses, 87 parish churches, 44 Company Halls, the Royal Exchange, the Custom House, St Paul's Cathedral, the Bridewell Palace and other City prisons, the General Letter Office, and the three western city gates—Ludgate, Newgate, and Aldersgate.",1
459,a459,b459,(equivalent to £1.66 billion in  2018).,"Evelyn believed that he saw as many as ""200,000 people of all ranks and stations dispersed, and lying along their heaps of what they could save"" in the fields towards Islington and Highgate.An example of the urge to identify scapegoats for the fire is the acceptance of the confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster.Abroad in the Netherlands, the Great Fire of London was seen as a divine retribution for Holmes's Bonfire, the burning by the English of a Dutch town during the Second Anglo-Dutch War.On 5 October, Marc Antonio Giustinian, Venetian Ambassador in France, reported to the Doge of Venice and the Senate, that Louis XIV announced that he would not ""have any rejoicings about it, being such a deplorable accident involving injury to so many unhappy people"".",1
460,a460,b460,"Louis had made an offer to his aunt, the British Queen Henrietta Maria, to send food and whatever goods might be of aid in alleviating the plight of Londoners, yet he made no secret that he regarded ""the fire of London as a stroke of good fortune for him "" as it reduced the risk of French ships crossing the Channel and the North Sea being taken or sunk by the English fleet.In the chaos and unrest after the fire, Charles II feared another London rebellion.","He encouraged the homeless to move away from London and settle elsewhere, immediately issuing a proclamation that ""all Cities and Towns whatsoever shall without any contradiction receive the said distressed persons and permit them the free exercise of their manual trades.""",1
461,a461,b461,"A special Fire Court was set up to deal with disputes between tenants and landlords and decide who should rebuild, based on ability to pay.",The Court was in session from February 1667 to September 1672.,1
462,a462,b462,"Cases were heard and a verdict usually given within a day; without the Fire Court, lengthy legal wrangles would have seriously delayed the rebuilding which was so necessary if London was to recover.Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles.","If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right).",1
463,a463,b463,"The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish ""to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong"" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned.","Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose.",1
464,a464,b464,"Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans.With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid.","Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood.",1
465,a465,b465,"New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches.On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as ""The Monument"".",It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station.,1
466,a466,b466,"In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which read, in part:The inscription remained until after the passage of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 when it was removed in 1830 following a successful campaign by City Solicitor Charles Pearson.Another monument marks the spot where the fire stopped: the Golden Boy of Pye Corner in Smithfield.","According to the inscription, it was evidence of God's wrath on the City of London for the sin of gluttony that the fire started at Pudding Lane and stopped at Pye Corner.The Great Plague epidemic of 1665 is believed to have killed a sixth of London's inhabitants, or 80,000 people,Following the Fire, the thoroughfares of Queen Street and King Street were newly laid out, cutting across more ancient thoroughfares in the City, creating a new route up from the Thames to the Guildhall; they were the only notable new streets following the fire's destruction of much of the City.William Harrison Ainsworth's novel Old St Paul's is set during the events of the fire.The Great Fire was released on ITV television in 2014.",1

518,a518,b518,"Despite these constraints, Hayes oversaw the establishment of a school for deaf-mutes and a reform school for girls.","Hayes was re-elected with an increased majority, and the Republicans took the legislature, ensuring Ohio's ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guaranteed black (male) suffrage.",1
519,a519,b519,"With a Republican legislature, Hayes's second term was more enjoyable.","Suffrage was expanded and a state Agricultural and Mechanical College (later to become The Ohio State University) established.As Hayes prepared to leave office, several delegations of reform-minded Republicans urged him to run against the incumbent Republican, John Sherman, for United States Senate.",1
520,a520,b520,"Hayes especially looked forward to spending time with his children, two of whom (daughter Fanny and son Scott) had been born in the past five years.In 1873, Lucy gave birth to another son, Manning Force Hayes.","That year Hayes announced his uncle's bequest of $50,000 in assets to endow a public library for Fremont, to be called the Birchard Library.",1
521,a521,b521,"It opened in 1874 on Front Street, and a new building was completed and opened in 1878 in Fort Stephenson State Park.",(This site was per the terms of the bequest.),1
522,a522,b522,"Hayes served as chairman of the library's Board of Trustees until his death.Hayes hoped to stay out of politics in order to pay off the debts he had incurred during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted.Hayes's success in Ohio immediately elevated him to the top ranks of Republican politicians under consideration for the presidency in 1876.The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York.","Tilden was considered a formidable adversary who, like Hayes, had a reputation for honesty.As the returns were tallied on election day, it was clear that the race was close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey.",1
523,a523,b523,"In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic.","Although Tilden had won the popular vote and claimed 184 electoral votes, Republicans leaders challenged the results and charged Democrats with fraud and voter suppression of blacks (who would otherwise have voted Republican) in Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina.On November 11, three days after election day, Tilden appeared to have won 184 electoral votes: one short of a majority.",1
524,a524,b524,"To further complicate matters, one of the three electors from Oregon (a state Hayes had won) was disqualified, reducing Hayes's total to 165, and raising the disputed votes to 20.","Hayes had to be awarded all 20 disputed votes, otherwise Tilden would be elected president.There was considerable debate about which person or house of Congress was authorized to decide between the competing slates of electors, with the Republican Senate and the Democratic House each claiming priority.As the March 4 inauguration day neared, Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders met at Wormley's Hotel in Washington to negotiate a compromise.",1
525,a525,b525,Republicans promised concessions in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the Committee's decision.,"The primary concession Hayes promised would be the withdrawal of federal troops from the South and an acceptance of the election of Democratic governments in the remaining ""unredeemed"" states of the South.Because March 4, 1877 fell on a Sunday, Hayes took the oath of office privately on Saturday, March 3, in the Red Room of the White House, the first president to do so in the Executive Mansion.",1
526,a526,b526,"He took the oath publicly on the following Monday on the East Portico of the United States Capitol.Hayes had been a firm supporter of Republican Reconstruction policies throughout his political career, but the first major act of his presidency was an end to Reconstruction and the return of the South to ""home rule"".Hayes's later attempts to protect the rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his attempts to rebuild Republican strength in the South.The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider.","Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more.Hayes tried to reconcile the social mores of the South with the recently passed civil rights laws by distributing patronage among southern Democrats.",1
527,a527,b527,"""My task was to wipe out the color line, to abolish sectionalism, to end the war and bring peace,"" he wrote in his diary.","""To do this, I was ready to resort to unusual measures and to risk my own standing and reputation within my party and the country.",1
528,a528,b528,"""Hayes took office determined to reform the system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president.To show his commitment to reform, Hayes appointed one of the best-known advocates of reform, Carl Schurz, to be Secretary of the Interior and asked Schurz and William M. Evarts, his Secretary of State, to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments.Although he could not convince Congress to prohibit the spoils system, Hayes issued an executive order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics.Hayes was forced to wait until July 1878, when he sacked Arthur and Cornell during a Congressional recess and replaced them by recess appointments of Merritt and Silas W. Burt, respectively.For the remainder of his term, Hayes pressed Congress to enact permanent reform legislation and fund the United States Civil Service Commission, even using his last annual message to Congress in 1880 to appeal for reform.","While reform legislation did not pass during Hayes's presidency, his advocacy provided ""a significant precedent as well as the political impetus for the Pendleton Act of 1883,"" which was signed into law by President Chester Arthur.Hayes also dealt with corruption in the postal service.",1
529,a529,b529,"In 1880, Schurz and Senator John A. Logan asked Hayes to shut down the ""star route"" rings, a system of corrupt contract profiteering in the Postal Service, and to fire Thomas J. Brady, the alleged ring leader and serving as Second Assistant Postmaster-General.In his first year in office, Hayes was faced with the United States' largest labor uprising to date, the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.Pittsburgh next exploded into riots, but Hayes was reluctant to send in troops without the governor first requesting them.By July 29, the riots had ended and federal troops returned to their barracks.","Business leaders praised Hayes, but his own opinion was more equivocal; as he recorded in his diary: ""The strikes have been put down by force; but now for the real remedy.",1
530,a530,b530,"Can't something Hayes confronted two issues regarding the currency, the first of which was the coinage of silver, and its relation to gold.","In 1873, the Coinage Act of 1873 stopped the coinage of silver for all coins worth a dollar or more, effectively tying the dollar to the value of gold.",1
531,a531,b531,"As a result, the money supply contracted and the effects of the Panic of 1873 grew worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable.The second issue concerned United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), a form of fiat currency first issued during the Civil War.","The government accepted these notes as valid for payment of taxes and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in gold.",1
532,a532,b532,"Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for specie (gold), however, few did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed.Most of Hayes's foreign policy concerns involved Latin America.","In 1878, following the Paraguayan War, he arbitrated a territorial dispute between Argentina and Paraguay.",1
533,a533,b533,"Hayes awarded the disputed land in the Gran Chaco region to Paraguay, and the Paraguayans honored him by renaming a city (Villa Hayes) and a department (Presidente Hayes) in his honor.The Mexican border also drew Hayes's attention.","Throughout the 1870s, ""lawless bands"" often crossed the border on raids into Texas.Outside of the Western hemisphere, Hayes's biggest foreign policy concern dealt with China.",1
534,a534,b534,"In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country.","As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages.Interior Secretary Carl Schurz carried out Hayes's American Indian policy, beginning with preventing the War Department from taking over the Bureau of Indian Affairs.Hayes dealt with several conflicts with Indian tribes.",1
535,a535,b535,"The Nez Perce, led by Chief Joseph, began an uprising in June 1877 when Major General Oliver O. Howard ordered them to move on to a reservation.","Howard's men defeated the Nez Perce in battle, and the tribe began a 1,700-mile retreat into Canada.Hayes also became involved in resolving the removal of the Ponca tribe from Nebraska to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) because of a misunderstanding during the Grant Administration.",1
536,a536,b536,"The tribe's problems came to Hayes's attention after their chief, Standing Bear, filed a lawsuit to contest Schurz's demand that they stay in Indian Territory.","Overruling Schurz, Hayes set up a commission in 1880 that ruled the Ponca were free to return to their home territory in Nebraska or stay on their reservation in Indian Territory.",1
537,a537,b537,"The Ponca were awarded compensation for their land rights, which had been previously granted to the Sioux.In 1880, Hayes embarked on a 71-day tour of the American West, becoming the second sitting president to travel west of the Rocky Mountains.","(Hayes's immediate predecessor, Ulysses S. Grant, visited Utah in 1875.)",1

541,a541,b541,Alcohol was not served again in the Hayes White House.,"Critics charged Hayes with parsimony, but Hayes spent more money (which came out of his personal budget) after the ban, ordering that any savings from eliminating alcohol be used on more lavish entertainment.Hayes appointed two Associate Justices to the Supreme Court.",1
542,a542,b542,The first vacancy occurred when David Davis resigned to enter the Senate during the election controversy of 1876.,"On taking office, Hayes appointed John Marshall Harlan to the seat.",1
543,a543,b543,"A former candidate for governor of Kentucky, Harlan had been Benjamin Bristow's campaign manager at the 1876 Republican convention, and Hayes had earlier considered him for Attorney General.","Harlan was nonetheless confirmed and served on the court for thirty-four years, in which he voted (usually in the minority) for an aggressive enforcement of the civil rights laws.Hayes attempted, unsuccessfully, to fill a third vacancy in 1881.",1
544,a544,b544,"Justice Noah Haynes Swayne resigned with the expectation that Hayes would fill his seat by appointing Stanley Matthews, who was a friend of both men.Hayes declined to seek re-election in 1880, keeping his pledge that he would not run for a second term.","In 1881, he was elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.",1
545,a545,b545,He served as commander-in-chief (national president) of the Loyal Legion from 1888 until his death in 1893.,"Although he remained a loyal Republican, Hayes was not too disappointed in Grover Cleveland's election to the presidency in 1884, approving of the New York Democrat's views on civil service reform.Hayes became an advocate for educational charities, advocating federal education subsidies for all children.In retirement, Hayes was troubled by the disparity between the rich and the poor, saying in an 1886 speech that ""free government cannot long endure if property is largely in a few hands and large masses of people are unable to earn homes, education, and a support in old age.""",1
546,a546,b546,"The following year, Hayes recorded his thoughts on that subject in his diary:In church it occurred to me that it is time for the public to hear that the giant evil and danger in this country, the danger which transcends all others, is the vast wealth owned or controlled by a few persons.",Money is power.,1
547,a547,b547,"In Congress, in state legislatures, in city councils, in the courts, in the political conventions, in the press, in the pulpit, in the circles of the educated and the talented, its influence is growing greater and greater.","Excessive wealth in the hands of the few means extreme poverty, ignorance, vice, and wretchedness as the lot of the many.",1

589,a589,b589,"However, because X-ray emissions are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, observation of celestial X-ray sources is not possible without lifting instruments to altitudes where the X-rays can penetrate.As a result of these surveys, eight new sources of cosmic X-rays were discovered, including Cyg XR-1 (later Cyg X-1) in the constellation Cygnus.",The celestial coordinates of this source were estimated as right ascension 19h53m and declination 34.6°.,1
590,a590,b590,"It was not associated with any especially prominent radio or optical source at that position.Seeing a need for longer duration studies, in 1963 Riccardo Giacconi and Herb Gursky proposed the first orbital satellite to study X-ray sources.","NASA launched their Uhuru satellite in 1970, as the speed of light restricts communication between more distant regions.",1

Miley from Leiden Observatory, and independently Robert M. Hjellming and Campbell Wade at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, It is a supergiant star that is, by itself, incapable of emitting the observed quantities of X-rays.","Hence, the star must have a companion that could heat gas to the millions of degrees needed to produce the radiation source for Cygnus X-1.Louise Webster and Paul Murdin, at the Royal Greenwich Observatory,With further observations strengthening the evidence, by the end of 1973 the astronomical community generally conceded that Cygnus X-1 was most likely a black hole.Cygnus X-1 has since been studied extensively using observations by orbiting and ground-based instruments.The compact object and blue supergiant star form a binary system in which they orbit around their center of mass every 5.599829 days.",1
592,a592,b592,"Earth's distance to this system is about 1,860 ± 120 parsecs (6,070 ± 390 light-years).The HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 system shares a common motion through space with an association of massive stars named Cygnus OB3, which is located at roughly 7003200000000000000♠2000 parsecs from the Sun.","This implies that HDE 226868, Cygnus X-1 and this OB association may have formed at the same time and location.",1
593,a593,b593,"If so, then the age of the system is about 7014157788000000000♠5±1.5 Ma.",The motion of HDE 226868 with respect to Cygnus OB3 is 7003900000000000000♠9±3 km/s; a typical value for random motion within a stellar association.,1
594,a594,b594,"HDE 226868 is about 7001600000000000000♠60 parsecs from the center of the association, and could have reached that separation in about 7014220903200000000♠7±2 Ma—which roughly agrees with estimated age of the association.With a galactic latitude of 4 degrees and galactic longitude 71 degrees, though the structure of the Milky Way is not well established.From various techniques, the mass of the compact object appears to be greater than the maximum mass for a neutron star.","Stellar evolutionary models suggest a mass of 7001200000000000000♠20±5 solar masses,—a region of space with a gravitational field that is strong enough to prevent the escape of electromagnetic radiation from the interior.",1
595,a595,b595,"The boundary of this region is called the event horizon and has an effective radius called the Schwarzschild radius, which is about 7004440000000000000♠44 km for Cygnus X-1.",Anything (including matter and photons) that passes through this boundary is unable to escape.Evidence of just such an event horizon may have been detected in 1992 using ultraviolet (UV) observations with the High Speed Photometer on the Hubble Space Telescope.,1
596,a596,b596,"As self-luminous clumps of matter spiral into a black hole, their radiation will be emitted in a series of pulses that are subject to gravitational redshift as the material approaches the horizon.","That is, the wavelengths of the radiation will steadily increase, as predicted by General Relativity.",1
597,a597,b597,"Matter hitting a solid, compact object would emit a final burst of energy, whereas material passing through an event horizon would not.","Two such ""dying pulse trains"" were observed, which is consistent with the existence of a black hole.The spin of the compact object is not yet well determined.",1
598,a598,b598,Past analysis of data from the space-based Chandra X-ray Observatory suggested that Cygnus X-1 was not rotating to any significant degree.The largest star in the Cygnus OB3 association has a mass 40 times that of the Sun.,"As more massive stars evolve more rapidly, this implies that the progenitor star for Cygnus X-1 had more than 40 solar masses.",1
599,a599,b599,"Given the current estimated mass of the black hole, the progenitor star must have lost over 30 solar masses of material.","Part of this mass may have been lost to HDE 226868, while the remainder was most likely expelled by a strong stellar wind.",1
600,a600,b600,"The helium enrichment of HDE 226868's outer atmosphere may be evidence for this mass transfer.If the progenitor star had exploded as a supernova, then observations of similar objects show that the remnant would most likely have been ejected from the system at a relatively high velocity.","As the object remained in orbit, this indicates that the progenitor may have collapsed directly into a black hole without exploding (or at most produced only a relatively modest explosion).The compact object is thought to be orbited by a thin, flat disk of accreting matter known as an accretion disk.",1
601,a601,b601,This disk is intensely heated by friction between ionized gas in faster-moving inner orbits and that in slower outer ones.,"It is divided into a hot inner region with a relatively high level of ionization—forming a plasma—and a cooler, less ionized outer region that extends to an estimated 500 times the Schwarzschild radius, or about 15,000 km.Though highly and erratically variable, Cygnus X-1 is typically the brightest persistent source of hard X-rays—those with energies from about 30 up to several hundred keV—in the sky.The X-ray emission from Cygnus X-1 can vary in a somewhat repetitive pattern called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO).",1
602,a602,b602,"The mass of the compact object appears to determine the distance at which the surrounding plasma begins to emit these QPOs, with the emission radius decreasing as the mass decreases.","This technique has been used to estimate the mass of Cygnus X-1, providing a cross-check with other mass derivations.Pulsations with a stable period, similar to those resulting from the spin of a neutron star, have never been seen from Cygnus X-1.",1
603,a603,b603,"Cygnus X-1 unpredictably changes between two X-ray states, although the X-rays may vary continuously between those states as well.","In the most common state, the X-rays are ""hard"", which means that more of the X-rays have high energy.",1
604,a604,b604,"In the less common state, the X-rays are ""soft"", with more of the X-rays having lower energy.",The soft state also shows greater variability.,1
605,a605,b605,The hard state is believed to originate in a corona surrounding the inner part of the more opaque accretion disk.,"The soft state occurs when the disk draws closer to the compact object (possibly as close as 7005150000000000000♠150 km), accompanied by cooling or ejection of the corona.",1
606,a606,b606,"When a new corona is generated, Cygnus X-1 transitions back to the hard state.The spectral transition of Cygnus X-1 can be explained using a two component advective flow solution, as proposed by Chakrabarti and Titarchuk.","A hard state is generated by the inverse Comptonisation of seed photons from the Keplarian disk and likewise synchrotron photons produced by the hot electrons in the Centrifugal Pressure-supported Boundary Layer (CENBOL).The X-ray flux from Cygnus X-1 varies periodically every 7005483839999999999♠5.6 d, especially during superior conjunction when the orbiting objects are most closely aligned with the Earth and the compact source is the more distant.",1
607,a607,b607,"This indicates that the emissions are being partially blocked by circumstellar matter, which may be the stellar wind from the star HDE 226868.","There is a roughly 7007259200000000000♠300 d periodicity in the emission that could be caused by the precession of the accretion disk.As accreted matter falls toward the compact object, it loses gravitational potential energy.",1
608,a608,b608,"Part of this released energy is dissipated by jets of particles, aligned perpendicular to the accretion disk, that flow outward with relativistic velocities.","(That is, the particles are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.)",1
609,a609,b609,This pair of jets provide a means for an accretion disk to shed excess energy and angular momentum.,They may be created by magnetic fields within the gas that surrounds the compact object.The Cygnus X-1 jets are inefficient radiators and so release only a small proportion of their energy in the electromagnetic spectrum.,1
610,a610,b610,"That is, they appear ""dark"".",The estimated angle of the jets to the line of sight is 30° and they may be precessing.,1
611,a611,b611,"One of the jets is colliding with a relatively dense part of the interstellar medium (ISM), forming an energized ring that can be detected by its radio emission.",This collision appears to be forming a nebula that has been observed in the optical wavelengths.,1
612,a612,b612,"To produce this nebula, the jet must have an estimated average power of 4–7037140000000000000♠14×1036 erg/s, or 7029900000000000000♠(9±5)×1029 W.In 2006, Cygnus X-1 became the first stellar mass black hole found to display evidence of gamma ray emission in the very high energy band, above 6992160217648699999♠100 GeV.","The signal was observed at the same time as a flare of hard X-rays, suggesting a link between the events.",1
613,a613,b613,"The X-ray flare may have been produced at the base of the jet while the gamma rays could have been generated where the jet interacts with the stellar wind of HDE 226868.HDE 226868 is a supergiant star with a spectral class of O9.7 Iab,The surface of HDE 226868 is being tidally distorted by the gravity of the massive companion, forming a tear-drop shape that is further distorted by rotation.","This causes the optical brightness of the star to vary by 0.06 magnitudes during each 5.6-day binary orbit, with the minimum magnitude occurring when the system is aligned with the line of sight.When the spectrum of HDE 226868 is compared to the similar star Epsilon Orionis, the former shows an overabundance of helium and an underabundance of carbon in its atmosphere.Like other stars of its spectral type, HDE 226868 is thought to be shedding mass in a stellar wind at an estimated rate of 6994249999999999999♠2.5×10−6 solar masses per year.The Roche lobe of HDE 226868 defines the region of space around the star where orbiting material remains gravitationally bound.",1
614,a614,b614,Material that passes beyond this lobe may fall toward the orbiting companion.,"This Roche lobe is believed to be close to the surface of HDE 226868 but not overflowing, so the material at the stellar surface is not being stripped away by its companion.",1
615,a615,b615,"However, a significant proportion of the stellar wind emitted by the star is being drawn onto the compact object's accretion disk after passing beyond this lobe.The gas and dust between the Sun and HDE 226868 results in a reduction in the apparent magnitude of the star as well as a reddening of the hue—red light can more effectively penetrate the dust in the interstellar medium.","The estimated value of the interstellar extinction (AV) is 3.3 magnitudes.Cygnus X-1 was the subject of a bet between physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne, in which Hawking bet against the existence of black holes in the region.",1
616,a616,b616,"Hawking later described this as an ""insurance policy"" of sorts.",In his book A Brief History of Time he wrote:This was a form of insurance policy for me.,1

644,a644,b644,Walter Bache (/ˈbeɪtʃ/; 19 June 1842 – 26 March 1888) was an English pianist and conductor noted for his championing the music of Franz Liszt and other music of the New German School in England.,"He studied privately with Liszt in Italy from 1863 to 1865, one of the few students allowed to do so, and continued to attend Liszt's master classes in Weimar, Germany regularly until 1885, even after embarking on a solo career.",1
645,a645,b645,This period of study was unparalleled by any other student of Liszt and led to a particularly close bond between Bache and Liszt.,"After initial hesitation on the part of English music critics because he was a Liszt pupil, Bache was publicly embraced for his keyboard prowess, even as parts of his repertoire were questioned.Bache's major accomplishment was the establishment of Liszt's music in England, to which he selflessly devoted himself between 1865 and his death in 1888.",1
646,a646,b646,"This was at the height of the War of the Romantics, when conservative and liberal musical factions openly argued about the future of classical music and the merits of the compositions written in their respective schools.","Bache featured several of the orchestral and choral works through an annual series of concerts, which he single-handedly funded, organised and promoted.",1
647,a647,b647,"Likewise, he played an annual series of solo recitals that incorporated Liszt's piano music.Bache's strategy for presenting these works was one of familiarity.","He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace.",1
648,a648,b648,"He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle.","The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts.",1
649,a649,b649,"Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.Bache was born in Birmingham, the second-oldest son of well-known Unitarian minister Samuel Bache, who ran a private school in conjunction with his wife, Emily Higginson.In Leipzig, Bache studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles and composition with Carl Reinecke.","He also became friends with a fellow student, Arthur Sullivan, who, he wrote, ""cannot play well, but ... has written some things which I think show great talent.""",1
650,a650,b650,"In Brother Musicians, Constance quotes ""a musician of high standing"" who was one of his circle of friends (possibly Sullivan or the pianist Franklin Taylor),Upon completing his piano studies in December 1861, the 19-year-old Bache travelled to Italy, staying in Milan and Florence with the intent of soaking in Italian culture before returning to England.Bache arrived in Rome in June 1862.","After some initial confusion (Liszt mistook Bache, who was nervous and tongue-tied, for someone wanting to borrow money) Bache wrote to Constance,I hope I have not exaggerated in talking about Liszt; he won't make me anything wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can spend some time with him and go through a good deal of music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;...",1
651,a651,b651,"The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.After a visit to Birmingham, Bache moved to Rome in 1863 and lived there the next two years.","While there he received private lessons from Liszt, one of the few pupils thus privileged; most of Liszt's students attended only his master classes.",1
652,a652,b652,"He also heard Liszt play his own music on many occasions in private homes, including a then-rare performance of the Piano Sonata in B minor.","Liszt helped him prepare for several public concerts in Rome and encouraged him to learn some difficult pieces that Bache initially felt unable to play; these pieces included Liszt's transcriptions of Gounod's Faust Waltz and Meyerbeer's ""Patineurs"" Waltz from his opera Le prophète.Bache supported himself as an organist at the English Church, where the chaplain had previously known Bache's brother Edward.Bache's studies with Liszt did not end when he left Italy.",1
653,a653,b653,"He attended Liszt's master classes in Weimar, Germany regularly until 1885.For Bache, Liszt wrote his concert arrangement of the Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel's opera Almira in 1879.Before he moved to Rome, in June 1863, Bache returned to Birmingham to raise funds for the erection of a memorial window to his brother Edward.","Among these efforts was a performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio St. Paul, at which his organ playing was noted, and a solo piano recital which featured a few pieces by Liszt.Dangerous or not, Bache soon began a lifelong crusade to win popularity for Liszt's works in England.",1
654,a654,b654,"In 1865 he began a series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer Gustave Garcia.The concerts, which were held in February or March and continued until 1886, became known as the ""Walter Bache Annual Concerts.","""At these concerts, Bache frequently appeared as soloist, accompanist or conductor, but he also engaged other artists in an attempt to show he was not giving the concerts out of self-aggrandizement.",1
655,a655,b655,"Bülow conducted two concerts, Edward Dannreuther led the orchestra in two concerts.","August Manns, the conductor of a series of orchestral concerts held at the Crystal Palace and an admirer of Liszt's works, led four concerts.For these concerts, Bache programmed five of Liszt's symphonic poems, the Faust and Dante symphonies, the Thirteenth Psalm and the Legend of St. Elisabeth.The concerts were a considerable financial outlay for Bache, who did not have a regular salary until 1881 and had to sustain himself through teaching.",1
656,a656,b656,"By 1873, he wrote, he had to ""decide whether I shall sacrifice myself entirely to the production of Liszt's orchestral and choral works (which after all can never be immortal as Bach, Beethoven and Wagner: here I feel that Bülow is right).","Or shall I make my own improvement the object of my life, and not spend a third of my income in one evening.",1
657,a657,b657,"""In addition to the orchestral concerts, Bache gave an annual series of solo recitals on Liszt's birthday, 22 October, between 1872 and 1887.Liszt remained grateful to Bache and thanked him on several occasions, writing to him, ""Without Walter Bache and his long years of self-sacrificing efforts in the propaganda of my works, my visit to London were indeed not to be thought of.","""Bache had long cherished the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had in that city had in large part to do with Bache's efforts.In the summer of 1867, Bache and Dannreuther formed ""The Working Men's Society,"" a small association to promote the music of Wagner, Liszt and Schumann in England, with Karl Klindworth as an elder statesman for the group.",1
658,a658,b658,The Society met regularly at one another's homes for the study and discussion of this music.,"The first study session met in December and consisted of the ""Spinning Song"" from Wagner's opera The Flying Dutchman, played by Dannreuther in Liszt's piano transcription.",1
659,a659,b659,"At the meeting the next month, the group tackled the first two scenes of Das Rheingold.",The meeting which followed featured a reading of Die Walküre.,1
660,a660,b660,Neither of the latter two works had been presented anywhere; their world premieres at the Munich Court Opera were still two years away.,Klindworth's special relationship with Wagner ensured that the group had access to the scores.,1
661,a661,b661,"In the July 1869 meeting, Liszt pupil Anna Mehlig played Liszt's First Piano Concerto for the group.Bache became a professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music in 1881.","The foundation of the Liszt Scholarship at that institution in 1886 was mainly due to his efforts.Bache died in London in 1888, at the age of 45, after a brief illness.",1
662,a662,b662,"He developed a chill and an ulcerated throat, which ""proved too much for his over-worked and highly strung nature.","""From his early concerts, Bache was noted for showing thoughtfulness in his interpretations and an excellent pianistic technique.While he was not the only pianist in England to play Liszt's works, Bache was significant in that he played works in concert for solo piano, two pianos and piano and orchestra.Like Bülow, Bache performed works from memory instead of from the printed page, at a time when doing so was a matter of open debate.Bache was considered authoritative in the music of Liszt.",1
663,a663,b663,"About his performance of the B minor piano sonata, the Musical Standard wrote that Bache had made the work his own, giving the impression that Liszt's interpretation of the piece and Bache's were essentially one.Bache received praise for the works of other composers, as well.","The Musical Standard wrote that he sounded at home with whatever the musical style of the pieces he played.Despite receiving positive reviews for his pianism, Bache's difficulties with the critics on behalf of Liszt's music had a negative backlash on his performing career.",1
664,a664,b664,"He was never invited to play with the Philharmonic Society, even after Liszt personally recommended him as a soloist.","While his playing was lauded, his choice of music (the Liszt arrangement of Weber's Polonaise Brillante for piano and orchestra) was derided as astoundingly impudent.",1
665,a665,b665,"William Speirs Bruce FRSE (1 August 1867 – 28 October 1921) was a British naturalist, polar scientist and oceanographer who organized and led the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (SNAE, 1902–04) to the South Orkney Islands and the Weddell Sea.","Among other achievements, the expedition established the first permanent weather station in Antarctica.",1
666,a666,b666,"Bruce later founded the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in Edinburgh, but his plans for a transcontinental Antarctic march via the South Pole were abandoned because of lack of public and financial support.In 1892 Bruce gave up his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh and joined the Dundee Whaling Expedition to Antarctica as a scientific assistant.","This was followed by Arctic voyages to Novaya Zemlya, Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land.",1
667,a667,b667,"In 1899 Bruce, by then Britain's most experienced polar scientist, applied for a post on Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery Expedition, but delays over this appointment and clashes with Royal Geographical Society (RGS) president Sir Clements Markham led him instead to organise his own expedition, and earned him the permanent enmity of the British geographical establishment.","Although Bruce received various awards for his polar work, including an honorary doctorate from the University of Aberdeen, neither he nor any of his SNAE colleagues were recommended by the RGS for the prestigious Polar Medal.Between 1907 and 1920 Bruce made many journeys to the Arctic regions, both for scientific and for commercial purposes.",1
668,a668,b668,"His failure to mount any major exploration ventures after the SNAE is usually attributed to his lack of public relations skills, powerful enemies, and his fervent Scottish nationalism.","By 1919 his health was failing, and he experienced several spells in hospital before his death in 1921, after which he was almost totally forgotten.",1
669,a669,b669,"In recent years, following the centenary of the Scottish Expedition, efforts have been made to give fuller recognition to his role in the history of scientific polar exploration.William Speirs Bruce was born at 43 Kensington Gardens Square  in London, the fourth child of Samuel Noble Bruce, a Scottish physician, and his Welsh wife Mary, née Lloyd.","His middle name came from another branch of the family; its unusual spelling, as distinct from the more common ""Spiers"", tended to cause problems for reporters, reviewers and biographers.In 1879, at the age of 12, William was sent to a progressive boarding school, Norfolk County School (later Watts Naval School) in the village of North Elmham, Norfolk.",1
670,a670,b670,"He remained there until 1885, and then spent two further years at University College School, Hampstead, preparing for the matriculation examination that would admit him to the medical school at University College London (UCL).","He succeeded at his third attempt, and was ready to start his medical studies in the autumn of 1887.During the summer of 1887, Bruce travelled north to Edinburgh to attend a pair of vacation courses in natural sciences.",1
671,a671,b671,"The six-week courses, at the recently established Scottish Marine Station at Granton on the Firth of Forth, were under the direction of Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson, and included sections on botany and practical zoology.The Dundee Whaling Expedition, 1892–93, was an attempt to investigate the commercial possibilities of whaling in Antarctic waters by locating a source of right whales in the region.The relatively short expedition—Bruce was back in Scotland in May 1893—failed in its main purpose, and gave only limited opportunities for scientific work.","No right whales were found, and to cut the expedition's losses a mass slaughter of seals was ordered, to secure skins, oil and blubber.",1
672,a672,b672,"Bruce found this distasteful, especially as he was expected to share in the killing.","In a letter to the Royal Geographical Society he wrote: ""The general bearing of the master (Captain Fairweather) was far from being favourable to scientific work"".Within months he was making proposals for a scientific expedition to South Georgia, but the RGS would not support his plans.From September 1895 to June 1896 Bruce worked at the Ben Nevis summit meteorological station, where he gained further experience in scientific procedures and with meteorological instruments.",1
673,a673,b673,on which Bruce sailed from London on 9 June 1896.Windward arrived at Cape Flora on 25 July where Bruce  found that Jackson's expedition party had been joined by Fridtjof Nansen and his companion Hjalmar Johansen.,"The two Norwegians had been living on the ice for more than a year since leaving their ship Fram for a dash to the North Pole, and it was pure chance that had brought them to the one inhabited spot among thousands of square miles of Arctic wastes.During his year at Cape Flora Bruce collected around 700 zoological specimens, in often very disagreeable conditions.",1
674,a674,b674,"According to Jackson: ""It is no pleasant job to dabble in icy-cold water, with the thermometer some degrees below zero, or to plod in the summer through snow, slush and mud many miles in search of animal life, as I have known Mr Bruce frequently to do"".On his return from Franz Josef Land in 1897, Bruce worked in Edinburgh as an assistant to his former mentor John Arthur Thomson, and resumed his duties at the Ben Nevis observatory.","In March 1898 he received an offer to join Major Andrew Coats on a hunting voyage to the Arctic waters around Novaya Zemlya and Spitsbergen, in the private yacht Blencathra.",1
675,a675,b675,"This offer had originally been made to Mill, who was unable to obtain leave from the Royal Geographical Society, and once again suggested Bruce as a replacement.Blencathra sailed for Spitsbergen, but was stopped by ice, so she returned to Tromsø.","Here she encountered the research ship Princesse Alice, purpose-built for Prince Albert I of Monaco, a leading oceanographer.",1
676,a676,b676,Bruce was delighted when the Prince invited him to join Princesse Alice on a hydrographic survey around Spitsbergen.,"The ship sailed up the west coast of the main island of the Spitsbergen group, and visited Adventfjorden and Smeerenburg in the north.",1
677,a677,b677,During the latter stages of the voyage Bruce was placed in charge of the voyage's scientific observations.In the following summer Bruce was invited to join Prince Albert on another oceanographic cruise to Spitsbergen.,"At Red Bay, latitude 80°N, Bruce ascended the highest peak in the area, which the Prince named ""Ben Nevis"" in his honour.It is uncertain how Bruce was employed after his return from Spitsbergen in autumn 1899.",1
678,a678,b678,"In his whole life he rarely had settled salaried work, and usually relied on patronage or on influential acquaintances to find him temporary posts.In 1907 the Bruces settled in a house at South Morton StreetBruce's chosen life as an explorer, his unreliable sources of income and his frequent extended absences, all placed severe strains on the marriage, and the couple became estranged around 1916.","However, they continued to live in the same house until Bruce's death.",1
679,a679,b679,"Eillium became a Merchant Navy officer, eventually captaining a Fisheries Research Ship which, by chance, bore the name Scotia.On 15 March 1899 Bruce wrote to Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, offering himself for the scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages.","Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year.",1
680,a680,b680,"He was then told, indirectly, to apply for a scientific assistant's post.On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he ""was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship"".Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: ""If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it  Unappeased, Markham wrote back: ""As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step Bruce replied formally, saying that the funds he had raised in Scotland would not have been forthcoming for any other project.","There was no further correspondence between the two, beyond a short conciliatory note from Markham, in February 1901, which read ""I can now see things from your point of view, and wish you success""With financial support from the Coats family, Bruce had acquired a Norwegian whaler, Hekla, which he transformed into a fully equipped Antarctic research ship, renamed Scotia.",1
681,a681,b681,"She retreated to Laurie Island in the South Orkneys chain, and wintered there in a bay he named Scotia Bay.","A meteorological station, Omond House (named after Robert Traill Omond),In November 1903 Scotia retreated to Buenos Aires for repair and reprovisioning.",1
682,a682,b682,"While in Argentina, Bruce negotiated an agreement with the government whereby Omond House became a permanent weather station, under Argentinian control.","The long voyage back to Scotland, via Cape Town, was completed on 21 July 1904.This expedition assembled a large collection of animal, marine and plant specimens, and carried out extensive hydrographic, magnetic and meteorological observations.",1
683,a683,b683,"One hundred years later it was recognised that the expedition's work had ""laid the foundation of modern climate change studies"",Bruce's collection of specimens, gathered from more than a decade of Arctic and Antarctic travel, required a permanent home.",Bruce himself needed a base from which the detailed scientific reports of the Scotia voyage could be prepared for publication.,1
684,a684,b684,"He obtained premises in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh, in which he established a laboratory and museum, naming it the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, with the ultimate ambition that it should become the Scottish National Oceanographic Institute.","It was officially opened by Prince Albert of Monaco in 1906.Within these premises Bruce housed his meteorological and oceanographic equipment, in preparation for future expeditions.",1
685,a685,b685,"He also met there with fellow-explorers, including Nansen, Shackleton, and Roald Amundsen.","His main task, however, was masterminding the preparation of the SNAE scientific reports.",1
686,a686,b686,"These, at considerable cost and much delay, were published between 1907 and 1920, except for one volume—Bruce's own log—that remained unpublished until 1992, after its rediscovery.In 1914 discussions began toward finding more permanent homes, both for Bruce's collection and, following the death that year of oceanographer Sir John Murray, for the specimens and library of the Challenger expedition.",Bruce proposed that a new centre should be created as a memorial to Murray.,1
687,a687,b687,"The Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory continued until 1919, when Bruce, in poor health, was forced to close it, dispersing its contents to the Royal Scottish Museum, the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), and the University of Edinburgh.On 17 March 1910 Bruce presented proposals to the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS) for a new Scottish Antarctic expedition.","His plan envisaged a party wintering in or near Coats Land, while the ship took another group to the Ross Sea, on the opposite side of the continent.",1
688,a688,b688,"During the second season the Coats Land party would cross the continent on foot, via the South Pole, while the Ross Sea party pushed south to meet them and assist them home.",The expedition would also carry out extensive oceanographical and other scientific work.,1
689,a689,b689,"Bruce estimated that the total cost would be about £50,000 (2019 value about £5,010,000).The RSGS supported these proposals, as did the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the University of Edinburgh, and other Scottish organisations.Shackleton's expedition was an epic adventure, but failed completely in its main endeavour of a transcontinental crossing.","Bruce was not consulted by the Shackleton relief committee about that expedition's rescue, when the need arose in 1916.",1
690,a690,b690,"""Myself, I suppose,"" he wrote, ""because of being north of the Tweed, they think dead"".During his Spitsbergen visits with Prince Albert in 1898 and 1899, Bruce had detected the presence of coal, gypsum and possibly oil.","In the summers of 1906 and 1907 he again accompanied the Prince to the archipelago, with the primary purpose of surveying and mapping Prince Charles Foreland, an island unvisited during the earlier voyages.",1
691,a691,b691,"Here Bruce found further deposits of coal, and indications of iron.At that time, in international law Spitsbergen was regarded as terra nullius—rights to mine and extract could be established simply by registering a claim.","A sum of £4,000 (out of a target of £6,000) was subscribed to finance the costs of a detailed prospecting expedition during the summer of 1909, in a chartered vessel with a full scientific team.",1
692,a692,b692,"The results, however were ""disappointing"", and the voyage absorbed almost all of the syndicate's funds.Bruce paid two further visits to Spitsbergen, in 1912 and 1914, but the outbreak of war prevented further immediate developments.During his lifetime Bruce received many awards: the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1904; the Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1910; the Neill prize and Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1913, and the Livingstone Medal of the American Geographical Society in 1920.","He also received an honorary LLD degree from the University of Aberdeen.Bruce, and those close to him, blamed Markham for this omission.",1
693,a693,b693,"No action followed this plea.No award had been made nearly a century later, when the matter was raised in the Scottish Parliament.","On 4 November 2002 MSP Michael Russell tabled a motion relating to the SNAE centenary, which concluded: ""The Polar Medal Advisory Committee should recommend the posthumous award of the Polar Medal to Dr William Speirs Bruce, in recognition of his status as one of the key figures in early 20th century polar scientific exploration"".After the outbreak of war in 1914, Bruce's prospecting ventures were on hold.",1
694,a694,b694,"He offered his services to the Admiralty, but failed to obtain an appointment.","In 1915 he accepted a post as director and manager of a whaling company based in the Seychelles, and spent four months there, but the venture failed.Bruce continued to lobby for recognition, highlighting the distinctions between the treatment of SNAE and that of English expeditions.",1
695,a695,b695,"Despite his irregular income and general lack of funds, his estate realised £7,000 (2019 value about £310,000).After Bruce's death his long-time friend and colleague Robert Rudmose Brown wrote, in a letter to Bruce's father: ""His name is imperishably enrolled among the world's great explorers, and the martyrs to unselfish scientific devotion.","""The early years of the 21st century, however, have seen a reassessment of Bruce's work.",1
696,a696,b696,"Contributory factors have been the SNAE centenary, and Scotland's renewed sense of national identity.","A 2003 expedition, in a modern research ship ""Scotia"", used information collected by Bruce as a basis for examining climate change in South Georgia.",1
697,a697,b697,"This expedition predicted ""dramatic conclusions"" relating to global warming from its research, and saw this contribution as a ""fitting tribute to Britain's forgotten polar hero, William Speirs Bruce"".An hour-long BBC television documentary on Bruce presented by Neil Oliver in 2011 contrasted his meticulous science with his rivals' aim of enhancing imperial prestige.","A new biographer, Peter Speak (2003), claims that the SNAE was ""by far the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientific expedition of the Heroic Age"".The same author considers reasons why Bruce's efforts to capitalise on this success met with failure, and suggests a combination of his shy, solitary, uncharismatic natureAs to his nationalism, he wished to see Scotland on an equal footing with other nations.CitationsOnline sources",1

765,a765,b765,"The word ""atom"" (Greek: ἄτομος; atomos), meaning ""uncuttable"", was coined by the ancient Greek philosophers Leucippus and his pupil Democritus (c. 460 – c. 370 BC).","Democritus's atomism was refined and elaborated by the later philosopher Epicurus (341–270 BC).In the fourteenth century, the rediscovery of major works describing atomist teachings, including Lucretius's De rerum natura and Diogenes Laërtius's Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, led to increased scholarly attention on the subject.",1
766,a766,b766,"The French Catholic priest Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655) revived Epicurean atomism with modifications, arguing that atoms were created by God and, though extremely numerous, are not infinite.",Gassendi's modified theory of atoms was popularized in France by the physician François Bernier (1620–1688) and in England by the natural philosopher Walter Charleton (1619–1707).,1
767,a767,b767,"The chemist Robert Boyle (1627–1691) and the physicist Isaac Newton (1642–1727) both defended atomism and, by the end of the seventeenth century, it had become accepted by portions of the scientific community.In the early 1800s, John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions).","For instance, there are two types of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively).",1
768,a768,b768,This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen.,"13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers.",1
769,a769,b769,"This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in multiples of discrete units — in other words, atoms.","In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.Dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions.",1
770,a770,b770,"For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen.","Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).In 1827, botanist Robert Brown used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a phenomenon that became known as ""Brownian motion"".",1
771,a771,b771,This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about.,"In 1905, Albert Einstein proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first statistical physics analysis of Brownian motion.The physicist J.J. Thomson measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, hydrogen.",1
772,a772,b772,"Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first subatomic particle to be discovered, which he originally called ""corpuscle"" but was later named electron, after particles postulated by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874.",He also showed they were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials.,1
773,a773,b773,"Thomson also incorrectly postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a uniform sea of positive charge.","This became known as the plum pudding model.In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the direction of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered.",1
774,a774,b774,"They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much.","However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model.",1
775,a775,b775,"To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom.While experimenting with the products of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table.In 1913 the physicist Niels Bohr proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon.","This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.Later in the same year Henry Moseley provided additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory.",1
776,a776,b776,"These results refined Ernest Rutherford's and Antonius Van den Broek's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table.","Until these experiments, atomic number was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity.",1
777,a777,b777,"That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.Chemical bonds between atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.The Stern–Gerlach experiment of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of atomic properties.","When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split in a way correlated with the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin.",1
778,a778,b778,"As this spin direction is initially random, the beam would be expected to deflect in a random direction.","Instead, the beam was split into two directional components, corresponding to the atomic spin being oriented up or down with respect to the magnetic field.In 1925 Werner Heisenberg published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics (Matrix Mechanics).",1
779,a779,b779,"One year earlier, in 1924, Louis de Broglie had proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves and, in 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom (Wave Mechanics) that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles.A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.The development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy.","The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge.",1
780,a780,b780,The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses.,"The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the whole number rule.In 1938, the German chemist Otto Hahn, a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get transuranium elements.",1
781,a781,b781,"Instead, his chemical experiments showed barium as a product.In the 1950s, the development of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies.Though the word atom originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various subatomic particles.","The constituent particles of an atom are the electron, the proton and the neutron; all three are fermions.",1
782,a782,b782,"However, the hydrogen-1 atom has no neutrons and the hydron ion has no electrons.The electron is by far the least massive of these particles at 6969911000000000000♠9.11×10−31 kg, with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques.","It was the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured, until the discovery of neutrino mass.",1
783,a783,b783,"Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges.","If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion.",1

786,a786,b786,Neutrons and protons (collectively known as nucleons) have comparable dimensions—on the order of 6985250000000000000♠2.5×10−15 m—although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined.,"The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick.In the Standard Model of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure.",1
787,a787,b787,"However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks.","There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge.",1
788,a788,b788,Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +2/3) and one down quark (with a charge of −1/3).,Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks.,1
789,a789,b789,"This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.The quarks are held together by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons.","The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more).",1
790,a790,b790,"The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons.","The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07 3√A fm, where A is the total number of nucleons.Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, called the atomic number.",1
791,a791,b791,"Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the isotope of that element.",The total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide.,1
792,a792,b792,"The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay.The proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as fermions.","Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time.",1
793,a793,b793,"Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud.A nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match.","As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay.",1
794,a794,b794,"However, with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus, which slightly modifies this trend of equal numbers of protons to neutrons.The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force.","Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei.",1
795,a795,b795,"For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus.If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E = mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light.","This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together.The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force.",1
796,a796,b796,"This force binds the electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape.","The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force.",1
797,a797,b797,"Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a particle and a wave.",The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wave—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus.,1
798,a798,b798,"This behavior is defined by an atomic orbital, a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured.","Only a discrete (or quantized) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular energy level of the electron.",1
799,a799,b799,The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state.,"Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon.",1
800,a800,b800,"These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the electron binding energy—is far less than the binding energy of nucleons.","For example, it requires only 13.6 eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom,By definition, any two atoms with an identical number of protons in their nuclei belong to the same chemical element.",1
801,a801,b801,Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element.,"For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form, also called protium), one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium) and more than two neutrons.",1
802,a802,b802,"The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element oganesson.","All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (bismuth) is so slight as to be practically negligible.About 339 nuclides occur naturally on Earth, of which 254 (about 75%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as ""stable isotopes"".",1
803,a803,b803,"However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even in theory.","Another 164 (bringing the total to 254) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible.",1

806,a806,b806,"As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element.","Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin.",1
807,a807,b807,"Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain ""magic numbers"" of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells.","These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the shell model of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide.",1
808,a808,b808,"Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons: hydrogen-2 (deuterium), lithium-6, boron-10 and nitrogen-14.","Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd–odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: potassium-40, vanadium-50, lanthanum-138 and tantalum-180m.",1
809,a809,b809,"Most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.The large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up.","The total number of these particles (called ""nucleons"") in a given atom is called the mass number.",1
810,a810,b810,"It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count.","An example of use of a mass number is ""carbon-12,"" which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).The actual mass of an atom at rest is often expressed using the unified atomic mass unit (u), also called dalton (Da).",1
811,a811,b811,"This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of carbon-12, which is approximately 6973166000000000000♠1.66×10−27 kg.",Hydrogen-1 (the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of 1.007825 u.,1
812,a812,b812,The value of this number is called the atomic mass.,A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the atomic mass unit (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is roughly 14 u).,1
813,a813,b813,"However, this number will not be exactly an integer except in the case of carbon-12 (see below).As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of moles.",One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about 7023602200000000000♠6.022×1023).,1
814,a814,b814,"This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1 u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram.","Because of the definition of the unified atomic mass unit, each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12 u, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012 kg.Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an atomic radius.",1
815,a815,b815,This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus.,"However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space.",1
816,a816,b816,Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond.,"The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin.",1
817,a817,b817,"On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right).When subjected to external forces, like electrical fields, the shape of an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry.","The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by group-theoretical considerations.",1
818,a818,b818,"Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites.",in pyrite-type compounds.Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of light (400–700 nm) so they cannot be viewed using an optical microscope.,1

821,a821,b821,"Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1 fm.The most common forms of radioactive decay are:Other more rare types of radioactive decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, or more than one beta particle.","An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion—a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays.",1
822,a822,b822,"A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay.",This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life.,1
823,a823,b823,"Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as spin.","This is analogous to the angular momentum of an object that is spinning around its center of mass, although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating.",1
824,a824,b824,"Spin is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant (ħ), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin ½ ħ, or ""spin-½"".","In an atom, electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.The magnetic field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field.",1
825,a825,b825,"However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin.","Due to the nature of electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state.",1
826,a826,b826,"Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.In ferromagnetic elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment.","The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction.",1
827,a827,b827,"When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field.","Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.The nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin.",1
828,a828,b828,Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium.,"However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) it is possible to polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization.",1
829,a829,b829,"This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.The potential energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence of its position reaches the minimum (the most absolute value) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when the distance from the nucleus goes to infinity, roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance.","In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level; see time-independent Schrödinger equation for theoretical explanation.",1
830,a830,b830,"An energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of electronvolts (eV).","The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e.",1
831,a831,b831,"stationary state, while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.",The electron's energy raises when n increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases.,1
832,a832,b832,"Dependence of the energy on ℓ is caused not by electrostatic potential of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.For an electron to transition between two different states, e.g.","grounded state to first excited level (ionization), it must absorb or emit a photon at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to Niels Bohr model, what can be precisely calculated by the Schrödinger equation.Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion.",1
833,a833,b833,"For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see Electron properties.The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level.","Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels.",1
834,a834,b834,Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output.,"(An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.)",1
835,a835,b835,Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting.,"This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level.",1
836,a836,b836,"For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon.",The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases.,1
837,a837,b837,"That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized.","This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.Valency is the combining power of an element.",1
838,a838,b838,It is equal to number of hydrogen atoms that atom can combine or displace in forming compounds.,"The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the valence shell, and the electrons inthat shell are called valence electrons.",1
839,a839,b839,The number of valence electrons determines the bondingbehavior with other atoms.,"Atoms tend to chemically react with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.The chemical elements are often displayed in a periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table.",1

981,a981,b981,"The Rokeby Venus (/ˈroʊkbi/; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or  La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.","Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid.",1
982,a982,b982,"The painting is in the National Gallery, London.Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez.","The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents.",1
983,a983,b983,"In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror.","She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction.",1
984,a984,b984,This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez.,"Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition.",1
985,a985,b985,"Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire.","In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London.",1
986,a986,b986,"Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.The Rokeby Venus depicts the Roman goddess of love, beauty and fertility reclining languidly on her bed, her back to the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif The female figure can be identified as Venus because of the presence of her son, Cupid.Venus gazes into a mirror held by Cupid, who is without his usual bow and arrows.","When the work was first inventoried, it was described as ""a nude woman"", probably owing to its controversial nature.Venus looks outward at the viewer of the paintingIntertwining pink silk ribbons are draped over the mirror and curl over its frame.",1
987,a987,b987,"The ribbon's function has been the subject of much debate by art historians; suggestions include an allusion to the fetters used by Cupid to bind lovers, that it was used to hang the mirror, and that it was used to blindfold Venus moments before.The folds of the bed sheets echo the goddess's physical form, and are rendered to emphasise the sweeping curves of her body.","contrast with the dark greys and black of the silk she is lying on, and with the brown of the wall behind her face.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving nude by Velázquez, but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th-century Spanish inventories.",1
988,a988,b988,"Two were mentioned in the Royal collection, but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main Royal Palace of Madrid.","A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel.Although the work is widely thought to have been painted from life, the identity of the model is subject to much speculation.",1
989,a989,b989,"In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies; however, the use of female nude models was frowned upon.The figures of both Venus and Cupid were significantly altered during the painting process, the result of the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted.Paintings of nudes and of Venus by Italian, and especially Venetian, artists were influences on Velázquez.","However, Velázquez's version is, according to the art historian Andreas Prater, ""a highly independent visual concept that has many precursors, but no direct model; scholars have sought them in vain"".One innovation of the Rokeby Venus, when compared to other large single nude paintings, lies in the fact that Velázquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer.",1
990,a990,b990,"as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid.","These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist.",1
991,a991,b991,"However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.The Rokeby Venus may have been intended as a pendant to a sixteenth-century Venetian painting of a recumbent Venus (which seems to have begun life as a Danaë) in a landscape, in the same pose, but seen from the front.","The two were certainly hung together for many years in Spain when in the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio (1629–87); at what point they were initially paired is uncertain.The portrayal of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th-century Spain.",1
992,a992,b992,"Works could be seized or repainting demanded by the Inquisition, and artists who painted licentious or immoral works were often excommunicated, fined, or banished from Spain for a year.Velázquez's patron, the art-loving King Philip IV, held a number of nudes by Titian and Rubens, and Velázquez, as the king's painter, need not have feared painting such a picture.The contemporary Spanish attitude toward paintings of nudes was unique in Europe.","Although such works were appreciated by some connoisseurs and intellectuals within Spain, they were generally treated with suspicion.",1
993,a993,b993,"Low necklines were commonly worn by women during the period, but according to the art historian Zahira Veliz, ""the codes of pictorial decorum would not easily permit a known lady to be painted in this way"".In 1632,In contrast, French art of the period often depicted women with low necklines and slender corsets; In northern Europe it was seen as acceptable to portray artfully draped nudes.","Examples include Rubens's Minerva Victrix, of 1622–25, which shows Marie de' Medici with an uncovered breast, and Anthony van Dyck's 1620 painting, The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis.In 17th-century Spanish art, even in the depiction of sibyls, nymphs, and goddesses, the female form was always chastely covered.",1
994,a994,b994,"No painting from the 1630s or 1640s, whether in the genre, portrait, or history format, shows a Spanish female with her breasts exposed; even uncovered arms were only rarely shown.Another attitude to the issue was shown by Morritt, who wrote to Sir Walter Scott of his ""fine painting of Venus' backside"", which he hung above his main fireplace, so that ""the ladies may avert their downcast eyes without difficulty and connoisseurs steal a glance without drawing the said posterior into the company"".The Rokeby Venus was long held to be one of Velázquez's final works.These revelations make the painting difficult to date.","Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its strong emphasis on colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period.",1
995,a995,b995,"The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's last visit to Italy.The painting passed from Haro into the collection of his daughter Catalina de Haro y Guzmán, the eighth Marchioness of Carpio, and her husband, Francisco Álvarez de Toledo, the tenth Duke of Alba.","In 1802, Charles IV of Spain ordered the family to sell the painting (with other works) to Manuel de Godoy, his favourite and chief minister.Venus was brought to England in 1813, where it was purchased by John Morritt for £500 (£ 32,000 in 2019), and on the advice of his friend Sir Thomas Lawrence.",1
996,a996,b996,"Morritt hung it in his house at Rokeby Park, Yorkshire—thus the painting's popular name.","In 1906, the painting was acquired for the National Gallery by the newly created National Art Collections Fund, its first campaigning triumph.",1
997,a997,b997,"King Edward VII greatly admired the painting, and anonymously provided £8,000 (£ 850,000 in 2019) towards its purchase,In part because he was overlooked until the mid-19th century, Velázquez found no followers and was not widely imitated.","In particular, his visual and structural innovations in this portrayal of Venus were not developed by other artists until recently, largely owing to the censorship of the work.Velázquez's portrait is a staging of a private moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep and intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus.",1
998,a998,b998,"However, the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude—without jewellery or any of the goddess's usual accessories—was echoed in later nude studies by Ingres, Manet, and Baudry, among others.","Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer, as does Velázquez's Venus, only through the reflection of the mirror.The 1961 film The Happy Thieves features a plan to steal the picture from a Spanish mansion.On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked Velázquez's canvas with a meat cleaver.",1
999,a999,b999,"Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day,Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork.The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, ""The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.""",Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork.,1
1000,a1000,b1000,Hurricane Gert was a large tropical cyclone that caused extensive flooding and mudslides throughout Central America and Mexico in September 1993.,"The seventh named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Gert originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 14.",1
1001,a1001,b1001,"The next day, the cyclone briefly attained tropical storm strength before moving ashore in Nicaragua and proceeding through Honduras.","It reorganized into a tropical storm over the Gulf of Honduras on September 17, but weakened back to a depression upon crossing the Yucatán Peninsula.",1
1002,a1002,b1002,"Once over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, Gert quickly strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane by September 20.","The hurricane made a final landfall on the Gulf Coast of Mexico near Tuxpan, Veracruz, with peak winds of 100 mph (155 km/h).",1
1003,a1003,b1003,"The rugged terrain disrupted the cyclone's structure; Gert entered the Pacific Ocean as a depression near the state of Nayarit on September 21, where it briefly redeveloped a few strong thunderstorms before dissipating at sea five days later.Gert's broad wind circulation produced widespread and heavy rainfall across Central America through September 15–17.","Combined with saturated soil from Tropical Storm Bret's passage a month earlier, the storm triggered widespread floods and mudslides that isolated numerous communities.",1
1004,a1004,b1004,"In Costa Rica, the blustery weather destroyed a national park and led to significant losses for the agricultural and tourism sectors.","Much of the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua and Honduras endured overflowing rivers, with many cities, villages, and crops in those countries left under water.",1
1005,a1005,b1005,"Although Gert's highest winds occurred upon landfall in Mexico, the worst effects in the country were due to an extreme rainfall event in the Huasteca region, where as many as 31.41 inches (798 mm) of rain fell.","As an increasing number of major rivers burst their banks, catastrophic flooding submerged extensive areas around the Pánuco basin.",1
1006,a1006,b1006,"Tens of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate, and scores of structures were demolished in what was described as the region's worst disaster in 40 years.In the wake of the hurricane, the road networks of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions.",Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income.,1
1007,a1007,b1007,"Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116 people lost their lives and 16 others went missing.","The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170 million (1993 USD).Hurricane Gert had a complex lifespan as a large and slow-moving tropical cyclone, repeatedly interacting with nearby landmasses and other atmospheric systems.",1
1008,a1008,b1008,"Its genesis can be traced to a tropical wave—an area of low pressure oriented north to south—that moved off the African coast well south of Dakar on September 5, 1993.","The wave tracked rapidly westward across the tropical Atlantic at a relatively low latitude, causing it to interact with the Intertropical Convergence Zone and fostering convection in its vicinity.",1
1009,a1009,b1009,"It developed a weak low-pressure center at sea level, which passed directly over Trinidad on September 11.","Despite having most of its cloud pattern move over the northern coast of South America, the system maintained its identity and emerged over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 13.",1
1010,a1010,b1010,"There, it began showing signs of development owing to favorable tropospheric conditions aloft, developing curved, well-defined bands of deep convection.","Based on the improved cyclonic structure alongside the presence of a surface circulation, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on September 14, when it was located 105 miles (165 km) north of the northern coast of Panama.From its inception onwards, the depression had a rather large wind field as observed from satellite images and rawinsonde data.",1
1011,a1011,b1011,"After tracking west-northwestward, the center of the storm moved ashore near Bluefields, Nicaragua, around 1800 UTC that day, producing winds of 40 mph (65 km/h).On September 17, Gert moved over the Gulf of Honduras, where it soon restrengthened into a tropical storm.","Its duration over water and its opportunity for additional strengthening were curtailed after a mid- to upper-level trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico turned the storm to the north-northwest, bringing it over the coast of Belize on the next day.",1
1012,a1012,b1012,"Once inland, Gert began to feel the effects of a high-pressure ridge to the northwest, which nudged the storm on a more west-northwestward course.","On September 20, data from a United States Air Force aircraft indicated that Gert had become a hurricane with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h); it attained its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale soon thereafter, with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg).Around 2100 UTC on September 20, Gert made a final landfall at peak intensity on the coast of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz.",1
1013,a1013,b1013,"The hurricane accelerated and weakened rapidly over the mountainous region of the Sierra Madre Oriental, deteriorating into a tropical depression by September 21.","Despite its declining strength, the large circulation remained intact as it crossed the country.",1
1014,a1014,b1014,"Gert exited the coast of Nayarit and entered the Pacific Ocean later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E.After confirming the development of a tropical depression, authorities in Costa Rica issued a green alertWhile Gert was still located over the peninsula, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for the Gulf Coast from the city of Veracruz northward to Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas.","By September 18, it was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and extended southward to Minatitlán, although the initial watch area was placed under a hurricane watch after Gert showed signs of strengthening.",1
1015,a1015,b1015,"The next day, the tropical storm watch from Soto La Marina to Nautla was upgraded to a hurricane warning as it became clearer where Gert would make landfall.Gert was a large tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan; it always remained close enough to the coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms.","In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over a large area, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico.",1
1016,a1016,b1016,"The disaster resulted in at least 116 deaths and 16 missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops and vegetation surmounted $170 million.Although Gert's center remained off the coast of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country.",A local weather station recorded 13.1 inches (332 mm) of rain during the storm.The floods ruined about 500 acres (2.0 km2) of banana crop and damaged oil palm plantations.,1

1196,a1196,b1196,His proposed planets would be responsible for a clustering of the aphelion distances of periodic comets similar to that of the Jupiter-family comets.The discovery of  Sedna's peculiar orbit in 2004 led to speculation that it had encountered a massive body other than one of the eight known planets.,Sedna's perihelion distance of 76 AU is too large to be due to gravitational interactions with Neptune.,1
1197,a1197,b1197,"Several authors proposed that Sedna entered this orbit after encountering an unknown planet on a distant orbit, a member of the open cluster that formed with the Sun, or another star that later passed near the Solar System.At a conference in 2012 Rodney Gomes proposed that an undetected planet was responsible for the orbits of some eTNOs with  detached orbits and the large semi-major axis Centaurs, small Solar System bodies that cross the orbits of the giant planets.","The proposed Neptune-massed planet would be in a distant (1500 AU), eccentric (eccentricity 0.4), and inclined (inclination 40°) orbit.",1
1198,a1198,b1198,"Like Planet Nine it would cause the perihelia of objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 AU to oscillate, delivering some into planet-crossing orbits and others into detached orbits like that of Sedna.","In 2015 an article by Gomes, Soares, and Brasser was published detailing their arguments.In 2014 astronomers Chad Trujillo and Scott S. Sheppard noted the similarities in the orbits of Sedna and 2012 VP113 and several other eTNOs.",1

1201,a1201,b1201,Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed as the gas was cleared from the outer parts of the proto-planetary disk.Planet Nine could have been captured from outside the Solar System during a close encounter between the Sun and another star.,"If a planet was in a distant orbit around this star, three-body interactions during the encounter could alter the planet's path, leaving it in a stable orbit around the Sun.",1
1202,a1202,b1202,"A planet originating in a system without Jupiter-massed planets could remain in a distant eccentric orbit for a longer time, increasing its chances of capture.An encounter with another star could also alter the orbit of a distant planet, shifting it from a circular to an eccentric orbit.","The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, A previous article reported that if the massive disk extended beyond 80 AU some objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn would have been left in high inclination (inc &gt; 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.The gravitational influence of Planet Nine would explain four peculiarities of the Solar System:Planet Nine was initially proposed to explain the clustering of orbits, via a mechanism that would also explain the high perihelia of objects like Sedna.",1
1203,a1203,b1203,"Of Planet Nine's other effects, one was unexpected, the perpendicular orbits, and the other two were found after further analysis.","Although other mechanisms have been offered for many of these peculiarities, the gravitational influence of Planet Nine is the only one that explains all four.",1
1204,a1204,b1204,"However, the gravity of Planet Nine would also increase the inclinations of other objects that cross its orbit, leaving the short-period comets with a broader inclination distribution than is observed.The clustering of the orbits of TNOs with large semi-major axes was first described by Trujillo and Sheppard, who noted similarities between the orbits of Sedna and 2012 VP113.","Without the presence of Planet Nine, these orbits should be distributed randomly, without preference for any direction.",1

1206,a1206,b1206,"After eliminating the objects in Trujillo and Sheppard's original analysis that were unstable due to close approaches to Neptune or were affected by Neptune's mean-motion resonances, Batygin and Brown determined that the arguments of perihelion for the remaining six objects (Sedna, 2012 VP113, 2004 VN112, 2010 GB174, 2000 CR105, and 2010 VZ98) were clustered around 7000555014702134197♠318°±8°.","This finding did not agree with how the Kozai mechanism would tend to align orbits with arguments of perihelion at 0° or 180°.Batygin and Brown also found that the orbits of the six eTNOs with semi-major axes greater than 250 AU and perihelia beyond 30 AU (Sedna, 2012 VP113, 2004 VN112, 2010 GB174, 2007 TG422, and 2013 RF98) were aligned in space with their perihelia in roughly the same direction, resulting in a clustering of their longitudes of perihelion, the location where they make their closest approaches to the Sun.",1
1207,a1207,b1207,"The orbits of the six objects were also tilted with respect to that of the ecliptic and approximately coplanar, producing a clustering of their longitudes of ascending nodes, the directions where they each rise through the ecliptic.",They determined that there was only a 0.007% likelihood that this combination of alignments was due to chance.Two of the six objects (2013 RF98 and 2004 VN112) also have very similar orbits and spectra.In a later article Trujillo and Sheppard noted a correlation between the longitude of perihelion and the argument of perihelion of the TNOs with semi-major axes greater than 150 AU.,1
1208,a1208,b1208,"Those with a longitude of perihelion of 0–120° have arguments of perihelion between 280–360°, and those with longitude of perihelion between 180° and 340° have arguments of perihelion between 0° and 40°.",The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%.,1
1209,a1209,b1209,"They suggested that the correlation is due to the orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to a massive planet by passing above or below its orbit.A 2017 article by Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos noted that distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the eTNOs, and those of centaurs and comets with large semi-major axes, may be bimodal.",They suggest it is due to the eTNOs avoiding close approaches to a planet with a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU.The clustering of the orbits of eTNOs and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine.,1
1210,a1210,b1210,"In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown, swarms of objects with large semi-major axesIn their original analysis Batygin and Brown found that the distribution of the orbits of the first six eTNOs was best reproduced in simulations using a 10 Earth massThese parameters for Planet Nine produce different simulated effects on TNOs.","Objects with semi-major axis greater than 250 AU are strongly anti-aligned with Planet Nine, with perihelia opposite Planet Nine's perihelion.",1

1213,a1213,b1213,On very long timescales Planet Nine exerts a torque on the orbits of the eTNOs that varies with the alignment of their orbits with Planet Nine's.,"The resulting exchanges of angular momentum cause the perihelia to rise, placing them in Sedna-like orbits, and later fall, returning them to their original orbits after several hundred million years.",1
1214,a1214,b1214,"The motion of their directions of perihelion also reverses when their eccentricities are small, keeping the objects anti-aligned, see blue curves on diagram, or aligned, red curves.","On shorter timescales mean-motion resonances with Planet Nine provides phase protection, which stabilizes their orbits by slightly altering the objects' semi-major axes, keeping their orbits synchronized with Planet Nine's and preventing close approaches.",1
1215,a1215,b1215,"The gravity of Neptune and the other giant planets, and the inclination of Planet Nine's orbit, weaken this protection.","This results in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances, including high order resonances such as 27:17, on million-year timescales.Planet Nine can deliver eTNOs into orbits roughly perpendicular to the ecliptic.A population of high-inclination TNOs with semi-major axes less than 100 AU may be generated by the combined effects of Planet Nine and the other giant planets.",1
1216,a1216,b1216,The eTNOs that enter perpendicular orbits have perihelia low enough for their orbits to intersect those of Neptune or the other giant planets.,"An encounter with one of these planets can lower an eTNO's semi-major axis to below 100 AU, where the object's orbits is no longer controlled by Planet Nine, leaving it on orbits like 2008 KV42.",1
1217,a1217,b1217,The predicted orbital distribution of the longest lived of these objects is nonuniform.,Most would have orbits with perihelia ranging from 5 AU to 35 AU and inclinations below 110 degree; beyond a gap with few objects are would be others with inclinations near 150 degrees and perihelia near 10 AU.Planet Nine would alter the source regions and the inclination distribution of comets.,1
1218,a1218,b1218,In simulations of the migration of the giant planets described by the Nice model fewer objects are captured in the Oort cloud when Planet Nine is included.,Other objects would be captured in a cloud of objects dynamically controlled by Planet Nine.,1

1232,a1232,b1232,"The remaining regions include the direction of its aphelion, where it would be too faint to be spotted by these surveys, and near the plane of the Milky Way, where it would be difficult to distinguish from the numerous stars.","This search included the archival data from the Catalina Sky Survey to magnitude c. 19, Pan-STARRS to magnitude 21.5, and infrared data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite.Other researchers have been conducting searches of existing data.",1
1233,a1233,b1233,"David Gerdes, who helped develop the camera used in the Dark Energy Survey, claims that software designed to identify distant Solar System objects such as 2014 UZ224 could find Planet Nine if it was imaged as part of that survey, which covered a quarter of the southern sky.",A search combining multiple images collected by WISE and NEOWISE data has also been conducted without detecting Planet Nine.,1
1234,a1234,b1234,"This search covered regions of the sky away from the galactic plane at the ""W1"" wavelength (the 3.4 μm wavelength used by WISE) and is estimated to be able to detect a 10-Earth mass object out to 800–900 AU.Because the planet is predicted to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary search is expected to be carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the search.Although a distant planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, it would still be radiating the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass.","At its estimated temperature of 47 K (−226.2 °C) the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths.The Zooniverse Backyard Worlds project, started in February 2017, is using archival data from the WISE spacecraft to search for Planet Nine.",1

1236,a1236,b1236,"The analysis, using Batygin and Brown's orbital parameters for Planet Nine, suggests that the lack of perturbations to Saturn's orbit is best explained if Planet Nine is located at a true anomaly of 7000205599785884932♠117.8°+11°−10°.","At this location, Planet Nine would be approximately 7013942466585410000♠630 AU from the Sun,An later analysis of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints on possible locations of Planet Nine.",1
1237,a1237,b1237,Holman and Payne developed a more efficient model that allowed them to explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis.,The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit.,1

1239,a1239,b1239,"This could produce a signature in the measurements of Cassini, but JPL has seen no unexplained signatures in Cassini data.An analysis in 2016 of Pluto's orbit by Holman and Payne found perturbations much larger than predicted by Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit for Planet Nine.","Holman and Payne suggested three possible explanations: systematic errors in the measurements of Pluto's orbit; an unmodeled mass in the Solar System, such as a small planet in the range of 60–7013149597870700000♠100 AU (potentially explaining the Kuiper cliff); or a planet more massive or closer to the Sun instead of the planet predicted by Batygin and Brown.An analysis of the orbits of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial article.",1

1242,a1242,b1242,"These objects would be in resonance and anti-aligned with Planet Nine if it had a semi-major axis of 315 AU, below the range proposed by Batygin and Brown.","Alternatively, they could be in resonance with Planet Nine, but have orbital orientations that circulate instead of being confined by Planet Nine if it had a semi-major axis of 505 AU.A later analysis by Elizabeth Bailey, Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin found that if Planet Nine is in an eccentric and inclined orbit the capture of many of the eTNOs in higher order resonances and their chaotic transfer between resonances prevent the identification of Planet Nine's semi-major axis using current observations.",1
1243,a1243,b1243,They also determined that the odds of the first six objects observed being in N/1 or N/2 period ratios with Planet Nine are less than 5% if it has an eccentric orbit.Planet Nine does not have an official name and will not receive one unless its existence is confirmed via imaging.,"Only two planets, Uranus and Neptune, have been discovered in recorded history.",1

West, As a result of this and his desire to serve boys who had limited opportunities as he himself did when he was young, Boyce started a new Scouting-related venture: the Lone Scouts of America (LSA) on January 9, 1915.Boyce felt that Lone Scout was the best magazine he had ever done.The fortunes of the LSA had begun to decline by 1920 when Boyce hired the first professional editor for Lone Scout, George N.

1540,a1540,b1540,The earliest well-known brahmin writers in Kannada were from the Hoysala court.,an important corpus of monastic Vaishnava literature relating to Dvaita (dualistic) philosophy was written by the renowned philosopher Madhvacharya in Sanskrit.Writing Kannada literature in native metres was first popularised by the court poets.,1
1541,a1541,b1541,"These metres were the sangatya, compositions sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument; shatpadi, six-line verses; ragale, lyrical compositions in blank verse; and tripadi, three-line verses.Beginning with the 12th century, important socio-political changes took place in the Deccan, south of the Krishna river.","During this period, the Hoysalas, native Kannadigas from the Malnad region (hill country in modern Karnataka) were on the ascendant as a political power.",1
1542,a1542,b1542,"In 1116, Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas of Tanjore and annexed Gangavadi (parts of modern southern Karnataka), early brahminical works (Vaishnava), works from the birth of the Bhakti (devotional) movement in the Kannada-speaking region, writings on secular topics, and the first writings in native metres (ragale, sangatya and shatpadi).As in earlier centuries, Jain authors wrote about tirthankars (saints), princes and other personages important to the Jain religion.",Jain versions of the Hindu epics such as the Ramayana and Bhagavata (tales of Hindu god Krishna) were also written.,1
1543,a1543,b1543,"Breaking away from the old Jain tradition of using the champu form for writing Kannada literature, Harihara penned poems in the ragale metre in Siva-ganada-ragalegalu (1160).",His nephew Raghavanka established the shatpadi tradition by writing a unique version of the story of King Harishchandra in Harishchandra Kavya (1200).,1
1544,a1544,b1544,Sisumayana introduced the sangatya metre in his Anjanacharita and Tripuradahana (1235).,"However, some scholars continued to employ Sanskritic genres such as champu (Ramachandra Charitapurana), shataka (100 verse compositions, Pampa sataka) and ashtaka (eight line verse compositions, Mudige ashtaka).The exact beginnings of the haridasa movement in the Kannada-speaking region have been disputed.",1
1545,a1545,b1545,"Belur Keshavadasa, a noted Harikatha scholar, claimed in his book Karnataka Bhaktavijaya that the movement was inspired by saint Achalananda Dasa of Turvekere (in the modern Tumkur district) in the 9th century.","However, neither the language used in Achalananda Dasa's compositions nor the discovery of a composition with the pen name ""Achalanada Vitthala"", which mentions the 13th-century philosopher Madhvacharya, lends support to the 9th-century theory.",1

R. Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, to be the greatest theorist of Kannada grammar; and Sumanobana, who was in the court of King Narasimha I and was the maternal grandfather of Keshiraja.","Harihara (1160) and his nephew Raghavanka (1200), poets who set the trend for using native metres, came from a Shaiva family (devotees of the god Shiva).The support of the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada language was strong, and this is seen even in their epigraphs, often written in polished and poetic language, rather than prose, with illustrations of floral designs in the margins.Writers bilingual in Kannada and Telugu gained popularity which caused interaction between the two languages, a trend that continued into modern times.",1
1548,a1548,b1548,The Veerashiva canon of the Kannada language was translated or adapted into Telugu from this time period.,"Palkuriki Somanatha (1195), a devotee of social reformer Basavanna, is the most well-known of these bilingual poets.",1

1574,a1574,b1574,He came from a family of famous poet-writers.,"Although five of Keshiraja's writings are not traceable, his most enduring work on Kannada grammar, Shabdamanidarpana (""Mirror of Word Jewels"", 1260), is available and testifies to his scholarly acumen and literary taste.",1
1575,a1575,b1575,"True to his wish that his writing on grammar should ""last as long as the sun, the moon, the oceans and the Meru mountain lasted"", Shabdamanidarpana is popular even today and is considered a standard authority on old Kannada grammar.",It is prescribed as a textbook for students of graduate and post-graduate studies in the Kannada language.,1
1576,a1576,b1576,"Although Keshiraja followed the model of Sanskrit grammar (of the Katantra school) and that of earlier writings on Kannada grammar (by King Amoghavarsha I of the 9th century and grammarian Nagavarma II of 1145), his work has originality.","Keshiraja's lost writings are Cholapalaka Charitam, Sri Chitramale, Shubhadraharana, Prabodhachandra and Kiratam (or Kiratarjuniyam).A major development of this period that would have a profound impact on Kannada literature even into the modern age was the birth of the Haridasa (""servants of Hari or Vishnu"") movement.",1
1577,a1577,b1577,"This devotional movement, although reminiscent in some ways of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12th century (which produced Vachana poetry and taught devotion to the god Shiva), was in contrast intimately devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme God.",The inspiration behind this movement was the philosophy of Madhvacharya of Udupi.,1
1578,a1578,b1578,Naraharitirtha (1281) is considered the first well-known haridasa and composer of Vaishnava devotional songs in Kannada.,"Before his induction into the Madhva order, he had served as a minister in the court of Kalinga (modern Orissa).Other writers worthy of mention are Mahabala Kavi, the author of Neminathapurana (1254), an account of the 22nd Jain tirthankar Neminatha, Ratta Kavi, a Jain noble, wrote a quasi-scientific piece called  Rattasutra (or Rattamala) in 1300.",1

1580,a1580,b1580,"Fleeing possible persecution from the Chola King (who was a Shaiva), Ramanujacharya sought refuge initially in Tondanur and later moved to Melkote.",But this event had no impact on Vaishnava literature in Hoysala lands at that time.,1
1581,a1581,b1581,"However, the teachings of Madhvacharya (1238–1317), propounder of the Dvaita philosophy, did have a direct impact on Vaishnava literature, in both the Sanskrit and Kannada languages.","This body of writings is known as haridasa sahitya (haridasa literature).Born as Vasudeva in Pajaka village near Udupi in 1238, he learnt the Vedas and Upanishads under his guru Achyutapreksha.",1
1582,a1582,b1582,He was initiated into sanyasa (asceticism) after which he earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha).,"Later, he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel India.",1
1583,a1583,b1583,"He successfully debated with many scholars and philosophers during this time and won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first notable disciple.","Unlike Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) who preached Advaita philosophy (monism) and Ramanujacharya who propounded Vishishtadvaita philosophy (qualified monism), Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (dualism).Madhvacharya taught complete devotion to the Hindu god Vishnu, emphasising Jnanamarga or the ""path of knowledge"", and insisted that the path of devotion ""can help a soul to attain elevation"" (Athmonathi).",1
1584,a1584,b1584,He was however willing to accept devotion to other Hindu deities as well.,"He wrote 37 works in Sanskrit including  Dwadasha Sutra (in which his devotion to the god Vishnu found full expression), Gita Bhashya, Gita Tatparya Nirnaya, Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya, Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya, Mayavada Khandana and Vishnu Tattwa Nirnaya.",1
1585,a1585,b1585,"To propagate his teachings he established eight monasteries near Udupi, the Uttaradhi monastery, and the Raghavendra monastery in Mantralayam (in modern Andhra Pradesh) and Nanjanagud (near modern Mysore).The writings of Madhvacharya and Vidyatirtha (author of Rudraprshnabhashya) may have been absorbed by Sayanacharya, brother of Vidyaranya, the patron saint of the founders of the Vijayanagara empire in the 14th century.","Bharatasvamin (who was patronised by Hoysala King Ramanatha) wrote a commentary on Samaveda, Shadgurusishya wrote commentary on Aitareya Brahmana and Aranyaka, and Katyayana wrote Sarvanukramani.",1

1588,a1588,b1588,"With the waning of Jain literary output, competition between the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava writers came to the fore.","The Veerashaiva writer Chamarasa (author of Prabhulingalile, 1425) and his Vaishnava competitor Kumaravyasa (Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari, 1450) popularised the shatpadi metric tradition initiated by Hoysala poet Raghavanka, in the court of Vijayanagara King Deva Raya II.",1

1591,a1591,b1591,"The Bhakti writers took the message of God to the people in the form of melodious songs composed using folk genres such as the kirthane (a musical composition with refrain, based on tune and rhythm), the suladi (a composition based on rhythm) and the ugabhoga (a composition based on melody).","Kumara Vyasa and Timmanna Kavi were well-known among the Brahmin commentators, while Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa were the most notable of the Bhakti writers.",1
1592,a1592,b1592,"The philosophy of Madhvacharya, which originated in the Kannada-speaking region in the 13th century, spread beyond its borders over the next two centuries.","The itinerant haridasas, best described as mystic saint-poets, spread the philosophy of Madhvacharya in simple Kannada, winning mass appeal by preaching devotion to God and extolling the virtues of jnana (enlightenment), bhakti (devotion) and vairagya (detachment).Vachana poetry, developed in reaction to the rigid caste-based Hindu society, attained its peak in popularity among the under-privileged during the 12th century.",1

1645,a1645,b1645,"In 1992 Chrisye recorded a cover single of Koes Plus' song ""Cintamu T'lah Berlalu"" (""Your Love has Passed"") with arrangement by Younky; the music video was again broadcast on MTV Southeast Asia and became the first Indonesian music video to be broadcast on the American version of MTV.","The following year, Chrisye paired up with Younky again to record Sendiri Lagi (Alone Again), a project which required four months of planning and another four months of recording;Although Sendiri Lagi did fairly well, in the beginning of the 1990s Chrisye began to feel pressure from the increasingly visual-oriented music industry and growing amount of young talent.Gauri tried for several weeks to persuade Chrisye to commit to the concert, and following Chrisye's introduction to Erwin Gutawa, who was scheduled to handle the arrangements,The concert, entitled Sendiri to demonstrate that ""100% Indonesian"" concerts could be successful,Following the success of his Sendiri tour, Chrisye began to explore the possibility of producing an album of his early hits, remastered by Gutawa.",1

1647,a1647,b1647,"After basic recording in Jakarta, Chrisye, Gutawa, and sound engineer Dany Lisapali spent two weeks in Studio 301 in Sydney finishing off the album.","The Philip Hartl Chamber Orchestra provided the music; the mixing and mastering was also completed in Sydney.After AkustiChrisye, Gutawa suggested that Chrisye try a new style, with more serious songs.",1
1648,a1648,b1648,"The two soon began collaborating on Kala Cinta Menggoda, again using an Australian orchestra.","Chrisye, however, found himself unable to record one of the songs, ""Ketika Tangan dan Kaki Berkata"" (""When Hands and Feet Speak""), written by poet Taufiq Ismail and based on verse 65 of the Qu'ranic sura Ya Sin; he would break into tears after singing only a couple of verses.",1
1649,a1649,b1649,"Eventually, the day before he was to leave for Australia, he completed the song with Yanti's support.","On 11 October Chrisye performed ""Indonesia Perkasa"" (""Powerful Indonesia"") at the opening ceremony of the 1997 Southeast Asian Games; the song was written for the event.Chrisye began work on a rearrangement of Badai Pasti Berlalu in 1999 at the request of Musica Studios – although he felt that the original album was fine – and once again teamed up with Gutawa.",1
1650,a1650,b1650,"The new album, which retained the title Badai Pasti Berlalu, cost Rp.800 million (US$95,000) to produce and promote, in part owing to the cost of employing an Australian orchestra, the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra.In 2001 Chrisye released the studio album Konser Tur 2001 (Concert Tour 2001), which included two new songs and several old ones.","The music video for one of the new songs, ""Setia"" (""Loyal""), was controversial owing to its portrayal of a woman in tight clothing.",1
1651,a1651,b1651,"Soon afterwards, Chrisye decided to cover some of what he considered the most important Indonesian songs since the country's independence in 1945, ranging from songs from the 1940s like Ismail Marzuki's ""Kr.","Pasar Gambir &amp; Stambul Anak Jampang"" (""Kroncong of Gambir Market and Stambul of the Cowlicked Child""), to the late 1990s such as Ahmad Dhani's ""Kangen"" (""Longing"").",1

1657,a1657,b1657,"The song's existence had been kept secret, and the recording date is unknown;According to Jockie, one of the main reasons that Chrisye was chosen to record ""Lilin-Lilin Kecil"" was that he had a unique voice with a soft timbre, which went well with the keyboards used; Jockie, however, felt that Chrisye's voice lost its dynamics when mixed with mellow music, which led him to give their collaboration Jurang Pemisah more of a rock feel.A writer for the Indonesian magazine Gatra described Chrisye's on-stage persona as ""stiff"", with very little movement.Chrisye chose his own costumes and at times experimented with different colours and designs.","In all his music videos he preferred to wear the same style of shirt, quipping in an interview with Kompas that he would only wear a different one if he had fallen into a ditch.Chrisye has been described as ""legendary""  by several journalists.",1

1664,a1664,b1664,"The history of Arsenal Football Club between 1886 and 1966 covers the time from the club's foundation, through the first two major periods of success (the 1930s, and the late 1940s and early 1950s, respectively) and the club's subsequent decline to mid-table status in the 1960s.Arsenal Football Club was founded in 1886 as a munition workers' team from Woolwich, then in Kent, now southeast London.",They turned professional in 1891 and joined The Football League two years later.,1
1665,a1665,b1665,They were promoted to the First Division in 1904 but financial problems meant they were liquidated and reformed.,"They were bought out by Sir Henry Norris that year and to improve the club's financial standing, he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, north London in 1913.",1
1666,a1666,b1666,"After the First World War he arranged for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in controversial circumstances.It was not until the appointment of Herbert Chapman in 1925 that Arsenal had their first period of major success; Chapman modernised and reformed the club's practices and tactics, and under him and his successor George Allison (who took over after Chapman's death in January 1934), Arsenal won five First Division titles and two FA Cups in the 1930s.","After the Second World War, Tom Whittaker continued the success, leading the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup.",1
1667,a1667,b1667,"After Whittaker's death Arsenal's fortunes gradually declined; by 1966, they were in mid-table obscurity and had not won a trophy in thirteen years.","This led to the dismissal of Billy Wright as manager in 1966, and with it the appointment of Bertie Mee, who would go on to turn around the club's fortunes.Arsenal were founded as Dial Square in 1886 by a group of workers employed by the Dial Square workshop at the Royal Arsenal, an armaments factory in Woolwich, Kent (formally part of the new County of London from 1889).Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers on an open field on the Isle of Dogs, which they won 6–0.During this period, Royal Arsenal started to win local trophies, winning both the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; they also entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1889–90.Woolwich Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons, and generally occupied mid-table before the appointment of Harry Bradshaw as manager in 1899; Bradshaw and his star signings, including goalkeeper Jimmy Ashcroft (Arsenal's first England international) and captain Jimmy Jackson, won promotion to the First Division in 1903–04.",1
1668,a1668,b1668,"However, Bradshaw moved on to Fulham in May 1904, before the Gunners had kicked a ball in the top flight.","Despite some strong performances in the FA Cup – the club reached the semi-finals in 1905–06 and 1906–07 – Arsenal were never able to challenge for the League title, only twice finishing above tenth place in the First Division between 1904 and 1913.The cause of this decline was the club's ongoing financial problems; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century, the club's geographic isolation, in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead (then on the outskirts of urban London), meant attendances and thus income were low.",1
1669,a1669,b1669,"To stay afloat, Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players (including Ashcroft, as well as Tim Coleman and Bert Freeman), and slowly started to slip down the table, which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell.","By the end of the decade the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11,000, a little over half of what it had been in 1904.Norris was acutely aware of the problems associated with Woolwich Arsenal's location, and was desperate to improve the club's income.",1
1670,a1670,b1670,"First, Norris tried to merge Woolwich Arsenal with his other club, Fulham.","When that was blocked by the Football League, Norris abandoned the merger and looked to move the club elsewhere, eventually picking a site in Highbury, north London.",1
1671,a1671,b1671,"Despite objections both from Woolwich-based fans and residents of Highbury,) on building the new stadium, designed by Archibald Leitch, on a divinity college's playing fields.","Woolwich Arsenal moved there in the 1913 close season, having finished bottom and relegated to the Second Division in 1912–13.",1
1672,a1672,b1672,"The move to Highbury brought about much larger crowds; the average attendance in Arsenal's first season at the new ground was 23,000 (compared to 11,000 at the Manor Ground) and rose further after promotion in 1919, finally warding off the spectre of financial ruin.The club controversially rejoined the First Division in 1919, The First Division was being expanded from 20 teams to 22, and the two new entrants were elected at an AGM of the Football League.","On past precedent the two places would be given to the two clubs that would otherwise have been relegated, namely Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.",1
1673,a1673,b1673,Instead one of the extra places was awarded to Chelsea - who had been the victims of a betting controversy - and a ballot was called for the remaining place.,"The candidates included 20th-placed Tottenham Hotspur and, from the second division, Barnsley (who had finished third); Wolves, (fourth); Birmingham (fifth later amended to sixth); Hull City (seventh); and Nottingham Forest (eighteenth).The League voted to promote sixth-placed Arsenal, for reasons of history over merit; Norris argued that Arsenal be promoted for their ""long service to league football"", having been the first League club from the South.According to Soar and Tyler, the announcement of the vote seemed to catch all the clubs, except Arsenal, unawaresNo conclusive proof of wrongdoing has come to light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he was found to have misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus.There appear to be no extant records of the meetings which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book Making the Arsenal proposes a different reason for their election in that year.",1
1674,a1674,b1674,The site argues that the match fixing issues of the final year of football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted.,"He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of whose players had been found guilty of match fixing) be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done.",1
1675,a1675,b1675,To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division.The club's return to the First Division was not immediately successful.,"Under Leslie Knighton, the club never finished better than ninth, and in 1923–24 came close to returning to the Second Division, finishing 19th and only a point clear of the relegation zone.",1
1676,a1676,b1676,"Arsenal did no better the following season, finishing 20th (although paradoxically the club were a lot safer this time, being seven points clear of the relegation places), which was the last straw for Norris; he fired Knighton in May 1925,Chapman reformed many of the club's practices, including modernising the training and physiotherapy regimes, adding numbers to the players' shirts in August 1928,Chapman's first signing was veteran Charlie Buchan from Sunderland; as well as his contributions on the pitch, Buchan would play an important part off it.","After Arsenal were beaten 7–0 by Newcastle United in October 1925, Buchan suggested a change to the formation to adapt to a relaxation of the offside law, adjusting Arsenal's formation to the ""WM"", strengthening the defence by pushing the centre half back into defence and the full-backs out to the wings.Arsenal came second in Chapman's first season, their best finish at that time,Chapman was not deterred, and continued to build his side, signing future captain Eddie Hapgood, as well as three of the club's great attacking players, David Jack, Alex James and Cliff Bastin; it was especially Alex James, Arsenal's playmaker in midfield, supplying the forward line and wingers, who became celebrated as the engine of the team.",1
1677,a1677,b1677,"Three years after their first Cup final, in 1929–30, Arsenal reached Wembley again, this time up against Chapman's old club Huddersfield Town.","The match was notable for being ""buzzed"" by the enormous German airship Graf Zeppelin.",1
1678,a1678,b1678,"Arsenal were not distracted from their task; they won 2–0 with goals from James and Lambert to bring home the club's first major trophy.On 30 August 1930, Arsenal helped create a new attendance record of 28,723 at Blackpool's Bloomfield Road ground.","They helped set it again over the next two seasons with crowds of 29,576 and 30,218.Their FA Cup success was the first in a decade in which Arsenal were the dominant club in England.",1
1679,a1679,b1679,"They won the First Division for the first time in 1930–31; Arsenal performed strongly in a free-scoring title race with Aston Villa, recording several heavy wins (including 7–1 against Blackpool, 7–2 v Leicester City, and 9–1 v Grimsby Town, which remains a club record for the top flight).","Arsenal won the title with two games to spare, and finished the season having scored 127 league goals (another club record), though Aston Villa managed to score 128, which is still a record for the most goals in an English top flight season.The following season, 1931–32, Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again, losing controversially to Newcastle United.",1
1680,a1680,b1680,"Arsenal had led 1–0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser came after a long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick;Arsenal bounced back the following season, winning their second League title.","Arsenal had started the season weakly, but then went on a long winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa, whom they beat 5–0 at Highbury in April to clinch the title.",1
1681,a1681,b1681,"One of the stand-ins, Tommy Black, was particularly to blame (conceding a penalty for Walsall's second), and was sold by an enraged Chapman to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was transferred to Brentford a week later.Arsenal had started the 1933–34 season solidly, but in January 1934 Herbert Chapman died suddenly from pneumonia.","Despite this, under caretaker manager Joe Shaw Arsenal retained the title that season; Hulme and James were both out with injury for a large portion, and so Arsenal were not the attacking side they had been the previous season, scoring only 75 in the League, compared with 118 in 1932–33.George Allison (who had formerly been a director of the club) took over the job of team manager in summer 1934 and soon signed new blood for the side, including wing halves Jack Crayston and Wilf Copping (whose signings had been initiated by Chapman), and striker Ted Drake.",1
1682,a1682,b1682,"With these new signings, Allison oversaw the completion of a hat-trick of League titles in 1934–35, and Arsenal were back to their attacking best; Drake scored a club record 42 league goals that season and Arsenal racked up a series of heavily one-sided scorelines reminiscent of the 1930–31 season (including 7–0 v. Wolves, 8–1 v. Liverpool, and 8–0 twice, v. Leicester City and v. Middlesbrough).","Such was Arsenal's strength that in November 1934, seven players that started for the England side that beat World Champions Italy 3–2 (in the so-called ""Battle of Highbury"") were on Arsenal's books, a record number of players from a single club, which still stands today.Arsenal's ongoing success attracted larger and larger crowds.",1
1683,a1683,b1683,"Arsenal's home, Highbury, was completely redeveloped, with Leitch's stands from 1913 demolished and replaced with modern Art Deco stands, parts of which remain to this day — the façade of the East Stand is now a Grade II listed building,Arsenal's dominance of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in 1935–36, winning 1–0 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake.","Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934–35 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme.",1
1684,a1684,b1684,"Nevertheless, they won a fifth League title in 1937–38, pipping Wolves on the final day of the season, to cap off a highly successful decade.Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, all first-class football in Britain was suspended, and the 1939–40 Football League season annulled.","Highbury was requisitioned as an ARP station, with a barrage balloon operating behind the Clock End.",1
1685,a1685,b1685,"During the Blitz, a bomb fell on the North Bank, destroying the roof and setting fire to the scrap that was being stored on the terrace.","With Highbury closed, Arsenal instead played their home matches at White Hart Lane, home of their rivals Tottenham Hotspur.In November 1945, with league competition still suspended, Arsenal were one of the teams that played a Dynamo Moscow side touring the UK.",1
1686,a1686,b1686,"With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces, Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players, including Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen, which led Dynamo to declare they were playing an England XI, The match, at White Hart Lane, kicked off in thick fog and the slick and technically proficient Dynamo won 4–3, after Arsenal had led 3–1 at half-time.Though the score is generally agreed upon, after that accounts of the match diverge; even the identity of the goalscorers is disputed.","English reports alleged Dynamo fielded twelve players at one point, and tried to pressurise the referee into abandoning the match when they had been behind; in turn, the Soviets accused Arsenal of persistent foul play and even alleged George Allison had bet money on the result (a claim that was later retracted).",1
1687,a1687,b1687,"With the fog obscuring much of the action, not to mention the language barriers and the early-Cold War mutual suspicion between both sides, it is unlikely any reliable account of the match will emerge.The war had claimed the lives of nine Arsenal first team players, the most of any top flight club, George Allison decided to retire from football at the end of that season, and was replaced by his assistant Tom Whittaker, a long-time servant of the club who had been trainer under Chapman.Whittaker enjoyed immediate success, winning the League title in 1947–48; led by captain Joe Mercer's strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of Reg Lewis and Ronnie Rooke, Arsenal were top of the table from October until the season's climax, winning by a seven-point margin.","However, given the age of the Arsenal side at the time (Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty, as were Denis and Leslie Compton), long-term success was not possible.",1
1688,a1688,b1688,"In response, Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman, Alex Forbes and Cliff Holton.","Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title, with the new blood they won the FA Cup in 1949–50, with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in a 2–0 win over Liverpool.The 1951–52 season saw the club nearly win the Double, but ultimately end up empty-handed; a series of injuries and a fixture pile-up at the end of the season saw Arsenal lose their last two matches, including the title decider against eventual champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on the last day of the season; A week later, Arsenal played Newcastle United in the 1952 FA Cup Final, with several recovering players rushed back into the first team; Walley Barnes was taken off injured with a twisted knee after 35 minutes (no substitutes were allowed then), and ten-man Arsenal suffered further injuries to Holton, Roper and Daniel, so that by the end of the match they had only seven fit players on the pitch; with the numerical advantage in their favour, Newcastle won 1–0 with a goal from George Robledo.Despite the disappointment of the previous season, Arsenal won their seventh League title in 1952–53; in one of the closest title races, they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing level on points.",1
1689,a1689,b1689,"That proved to be Arsenal's last trophy for seventeen years, as Arsenal's fortunes began to wane, particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956.As the club's fortunes declined, they found themselves unable to attract many stars (Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a notable exception), while up and coming players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs.","Jack Crayston and George Swindin, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success.",1
1690,a1690,b1690,"Apart from finishing third in 1958–59 and fifth in both 1955–56 and 1956–57, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table.","To make matters worse for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960–61.In 1962, Arsenal made the bold but ultimately unsuccessful step of appointing former England and Wolves captain Billy Wright as manager, despite his lack of managerial experience and the fact he had no prior experience with the club.",1
1691,a1691,b1691,"Like his two immediate predecessors, Wright was not very successful, although it was under his leadership that the club made their debut in European competition, in the 1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after finishing seventh in 1962–63.",and was replaced by club physiotherapist Bertie Mee.,1

1710,a1710,b1710,"Margaret Alice Murray (13 July 1863 – 13 November 1963) was an Anglo-Indian Egyptologist, archaeologist, anthropologist, historian, and folklorist.","The first woman to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom, she worked at University College London (UCL) from 1898 to 1935.",1
1711,a1711,b1711,"She served as President of the Folklore Society from 1953 to 1955, and published widely over the course of her career.Born to a wealthy middle-class English family in Calcutta, British India, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, training as both a nurse and a social worker.","Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898.",1
1712,a1712,b1712,"In 1902–03 she took part in Petrie's excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology.","Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the British Museum and Manchester Museum, it was at the latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of the Two Brothers – the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy.",1
1713,a1713,b1713,"Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.Murray also became closely involved in the first-wave feminist movement, joining the Women's Social and Political Union and devoting much time to improving women's status at UCL.","Unable to return to Egypt due to the First World War, she focused her research on the witch-cult hypothesis, the theory that the witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to a Horned God.",1
1714,a1714,b1714,"Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging new religious movement of Wicca.",From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Menorca and developed her interest in folkloristics.,1
1715,a1715,b1715,"Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed Assistant Professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935.",That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie's excavation of Tall al-Ajjul and in 1937 she led a small excavation at Petra in Jordan.,1
1716,a1716,b1716,"Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the University of Cambridge and City Literary Institute, and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death.Murray's work in Egyptology and archaeology was widely acclaimed and earned her the moniker of ""The Grand Old Woman of Egyptology"", although after her death many of her contributions to the field were overshadowed by those of Petrie.","Conversely, Murray's work in folkloristics and the history of witchcraft has been academically discredited and her methods in these areas heavily criticised.",1
1717,a1717,b1717,"The influence of her witch-cult theory in both religion and literature has been examined by various scholars, and she herself has been dubbed the ""Grandmother of Wicca"".Margaret Murray was born on 13 July 1863 in Calcutta, Bengal Presidency, then a major military city in British India.","His wife, Margaret (née Carr), had moved to India from Britain in 1857 to work as a missionary, preaching Christianity and educating Indian women.",1
1718,a1718,b1718,"She continued with this work after marrying James and giving birth to her two daughters.In 1870, Margaret and her sister Mary were sent to Britain, there moving in with their uncle John, a vicar, and his wife Harriet at their home in Lambourn, Berkshire.","Although John provided them with a strongly Christian education and a belief in the inferiority of women, both of which she would reject, he awakened Murray's interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments.Encouraged by her mother and sister, Murray decided to enroll at the newly opened department of Egyptology at University College London (UCL) in Bloomsbury, Central London.",1
1719,a1719,b1719,"Having been founded by an endowment from Amelia Blanford Edwards, one of the co-founders of the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF), the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie, and based in the Edwards Library of UCL's South Cloisters.Murray soon got to know Petrie, becoming his copyist and illustrator and producing the drawings for the published report on his excavations at Qift, Koptos.At this point, Murray had no experience in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at Abydos.","Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau.",1
1720,a1720,b1720,"Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position.","This led to some issues with some of the male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman.",1
1721,a1721,b1721,"This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in the feminist movement) led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints.During the 1903–04 field season, Murray returned to Egypt, and at Petrie's instruction began her investigations at the Saqqara cemetery near to Cairo, which dated from the period of the Old Kingdom.","Murray did not have legal permission to excavate the site, and instead spent her time transcribing the inscriptions from ten of the tombs that had been excavated during the 1860s by Auguste Mariette.On returning to London, Murray took an active role in the feminist movement, volunteering and financially donating to the cause and taking part in feminist demonstrations, protests, and marches.",1
1722,a1722,b1722,"Joining the Women's Social and Political Union, she was present at large marches like the Mud March of 1907 and the Women's Coronation Procession of June 1911.","She concealed the militancy of her actions in order to retain the image of respectability within academia.Various museums around the United Kingdom invited Murray to advise them on their Egyptological collections, resulting in her cataloguing the Egyptian artefacts owned by the Dublin National Museum, the National Museum of Antiquities in Edinburgh, and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, being elected a Fellow of the latter in thanks.Murray was dedicated to public education, hoping to infuse Egyptomania with solid scholarship about Ancient Egypt, and to this end authored a series of books aimed at a general audience.",1
1723,a1723,b1723,"In 1905 she published Elementary Egyptian Grammar which was followed in 1911 by Elementary Coptic (Sahidic) Grammar.In 1914, Petrie launched the academic journal Ancient Egypt, published through his own British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), which was based at UCL.","Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as de facto editor much of the time.",1
1724,a1724,b1724,"She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.The outbreak of the First World War in 1914, in which the United Kingdom went to war against Germany and the Ottoman Empire, meant that Petrie and other staff members were unable to return to Egypt for excavation.Margaret Murray, 1963.Murray's interest in folklore led her to develop an interest in the witch trials of Early Modern Europe.","In 1917, she published a paper in Folklore, the journal of the Folklore Society, in which she first articulated her version of the witch-cult theory, arguing that the witches persecuted in European history were actually followers of ""a definite religion with beliefs, ritual, and organization as highly developed as that of any cult in the end"".As a result of her work in this area, she was invited to provide the entry on ""witchcraft"" for the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1929.",1
1725,a1725,b1725,"She used the opportunity to propagate her own witch-cult theory, failing to mention the alternate theories proposed by other academics.","Her entry would be included in the encyclopedia until 1969, becoming readily accessible to the public, and it was for this reason that her ideas on the subject had such a significant impact.From 1921 to 1927, Murray led archaeological excavations on Malta, assisted by Edith Guest and Gertrude Caton Thompson.",1
1726,a1726,b1726,"She excavated the Bronze Age megalithic monuments of Santa Sofia, Santa Maria tal-Bakkari, Għar Dalam, and Borġ in-Nadur, all of which were threatened by the construction of a new aerodrome.",In this she was funded by the Percy Sladen Memorial Fund.,1
1727,a1727,b1727,"Her resulting three-volume excavation report came to be seen as an important publication within the field of Maltese archaeology.On the basis of her work in Malta, Louis C. G. Clarke, the curator of the Cambridge Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology, invited her to lead excavations on the island of Menorca from 1930 to 1931.","With the aid of Guest, she excavated the talaiotic sites of Trepucó and Sa Torreta de Tramuntana, resulting in the publication of Cambridge Excavations in Minorca.",1
1728,a1728,b1728,"Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience, such as Egyptian Sculpture (1930) and Egyptian Temples (1931), which received largely positive reviews.In 1924, UCL promoted Murray to the position of assistant professor,During Murray's 1935 trip to Palestine, she had taken the opportunity to visit Petra in neighbouring Jordan.","Intrigued by the site, in March and April 1937 she returned in order to carry out a small excavation in several cave dwellings at the site, subsequently writing both an excavation report and a guidebook on Petra.During the Second World War, Murray evaded the Blitz of London by moving to Cambridge, where she volunteered for a group (probably the Army Bureau of Current Affairs or The British Way and Purpose) who educated military personnel to prepare them for post-war life.After the war ended she returned to London, settling into a bedsit room in Endsleigh Street, which was close to University College London (UCL) and the Institute of Archaeology (then an independent institution, now part of UCL); she continued her involvement with the former and made use of the latter's library.Murray's interest in popularising Egyptology among the wider public continued; in 1949 she published Ancient Egyptian Religious Poetry, her second work for John Murray's ""The Wisdom of the East"" series.Glyn Daniel, 1964.In 1953, Murray was appointed to the presidency of the Folklore Society following the resignation of former president Allan Gomme.",1
1729,a1729,b1729,"The Society had initially approached John Mavrogordato for the post, but he had declined, with Murray accepting the nomination several months later.","Murray remained President for two terms, until 1955.In May 1957, Murray had championed the archaeologist T. C. Lethbridge's controversial claims that he had discovered three pre-Christian chalk hill figures on Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire.",1
1730,a1730,b1730,"Privately she expressed concern about the reality of the figures.Crippled with arthritis, Murray had moved into a home in North Finchley, north London, where she was cared for by a retired couple who were trained nurses; from here she occasionally took taxis into central London to visit the UCL library.The later folklorists Caroline Oates and Juliette Wood have suggested that Murray was best known for her witch-cult theory, as well as being the first to have actually ""empowered the witches"" by giving the (largely female) accused both free will and a voice distinct from that of their interrogators.Mimi Winick, 2015.In The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and New England.Members joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called ""admission ceremonies""; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will, and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity.","She also claimed that in some cases, these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptised into the faith.Describing this witch-cult as ""a joyous religion"",Deeming Ritual Witchcraft to be ""a fertility cult"", she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making.Murray asserted that a pre-Christian fertility-based religion had survived the Christianization process in Britain, although that it came to be ""practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community"".The later historian Ronald Hutton commented that The Witch-Cult in Western Europe ""rested upon a small amount of archival research, with extensive use of printed trial records in 19th-century editions, plus early modern pamphlets and works of demonology"".Murray followed The Witch-Cult in Western Europe with The God of the Witches, published by the popular press Sampson Low in 1931; although similar in content, unlike her previous volume it was aimed at a mass market audience.In this book she began to refer to the witches' deity as the Horned God, and asserted that it was an entity who had been worshipped in Europe since the Palaeolithic.In 1954, she published The Divine King in England, in which she greatly extended on the theory, taking influence from Frazer's The Golden Bough, an anthropological book that made the claim that societies all over the world sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature.",1
1731,a1731,b1731,"In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of William II was really a ritual sacrifice.Upon initial publication, Murray's thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers, including some significant scholars, albeit none who were experts in the witch trials.Rose suggested that the reason that Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her ""imposing credentials"" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers.George L. Burr, 1922.Murray's theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials,Soon after, one of the foremost specialists of the trial records, L'Estrange Ewen, brought out a series of books which rejected Murray's interpretation.Murray did not respond directly to the criticisms of her work, but reacted to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting out of their own Christian prejudices to non-Christian religion.Murray's work was increasingly criticised following her death in 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s.In 1975, the historian Norman Cohn commented that Murray's ""knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of historical method was non-existent"",Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander, 2007.Hutton stated that Murray had treated her source material with ""reckless abandon"",The Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg has been cited as being willing to give ""some slight support"" to Murray's theory.On researching the history of UCL's Egyptology department, the historian Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was ""remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students.","A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt.",1
1732,a1732,b1732,"""One of Murray's friends in the Society, E. O. James, described her as a ""mine of information and a perpetual inspiration ever ready to impart her vast and varied stores of specialised knowledge without reserve, or, be it said, much if any regard for the generally accepted opinions and conclusions of the experts!","""Murray never married, instead devoting her life to her work, and for this reason, Hutton drew comparisons between her and two other prominent female British scholars of the period, Jane Harrison and Jessie Weston.Raised a devout Christian by her mother, Murray had initially become a Sunday School teacher to preach the faith, but after entering the academic profession she rejected religion, gaining a reputation among other members of the Folklore Society as a noted sceptic and a rationalist.Hutton noted that Murray was one of the earliest women to ""make a serious impact upon the world of professional scholarship"",Jacqueline Simpson, 1994.In his obituary for Murray in Folklore, James noted that her death was ""an event of unusual interest and importance in the annals of the Folk-Lore Society in particular as well as in the wider sphere in which her influence was felt in so many directions anddisciplines"".In 1935, UCL introduced the Margaret Murray Prize, awarded to the student who is deemed to have produced the best dissertation in Egyptology; it continued to be presented annually into the 21st century.The historian of archaeology Rosalind M. Janssen titled her study of Egyptology at UCL The First Hundred Years ""as a tribute"" to Murray.Murray's witch-cult theories provided the blueprint for the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca,Noting that there is no evidence of Wicca existing before the publication of Murray's books, Merrifield commented that for those in 20th century Britain who wished to form their own witches' covens, ""Murray may have seemed the ideal fairy godmother, and her theory became the pumpkin coach that could transport them into the realm of fantasy for which they longed"".Ethan Doyle White, 2016.Murray's witch-cult theories were likely also a core influence on the non-Gardnerian Wiccan traditions that were established in Britain and Australia between 1930 and 1970 by the likes of Bob Clay-Egerton, Robert Cochrane, Charles Cardell, and Rosaleen Norton.Members of the Wiccan community gradually became aware of academia's rejection of the witch-cult theory.",1

1823,a1823,b1823,"Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives.","In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's conclusions.",1
1824,a1824,b1824,Explanations for the observed biases include wishful thinking and the limited human capacity to process information.,"Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way.",1

1826,a1826,b1826,An alternative (perhaps better) name is myside bias.,Confirmation bias is a variation of the more general tendency of apophenia - the tendency to mistakenly perceive connections and meaning between unrelated things.Confirmation biases are effects in information processing.,1
1827,a1827,b1827,"They differ from what is sometimes called the behavioral confirmation effect, commonly known as self-fulfilling prophecy, in which a person's expectations influence their own behavior, bringing about the expected result.Some psychologists restrict the term confirmation bias to selective collection of evidence that supports what one already believes while ignoring or rejecting evidence that supports a different conclusion.","Others apply the term more broadly to the tendency to preserve one's existing beliefs when searching for evidence, interpreting it, or recalling it from memory.Experiments have found repeatedly that people tend to test hypotheses in a one-sided way, by searching for evidence consistent with their current hypothesis.The preference for positive tests in itself is not a bias, since positive tests can be highly informative.Even a small change in a question's wording can affect how people search through available information, and hence the conclusions they reach.",1
1828,a1828,b1828,"This was shown using a fictional child custody case.Similar studies have demonstrated how people engage in a biased search for information, but also that this phenomenon may be limited by a preference for genuine diagnostic tests.","In an initial experiment, participants rated another person on the introversion–extroversion personality dimension on the basis of an interview.",1

1832,a1832,b1832,"Once they read the more detailed descriptions of the two studies, they almost all returned to their original belief regardless of the evidence provided, pointing to details that supported their viewpoint and disregarding anything contrary.","Participants described studies supporting their pre-existing view as superior to those that contradicted it, in detailed and specific ways.Another study of biased interpretation occurred during the 2004 U.S. presidential election and involved participants who reported having strong feelings about the candidates.",1

1846,a1846,b1846,"This evidence is consistent with the claims proposed in Baron's article—that people's opinions about what makes good thinking can influence how arguments are generated.Before psychological research on confirmation bias, the phenomenon had been observed throughout history.","Beginning with the Greek historian Thucydides (c. 460 BC – c. 395 BC), who wrote of misguided treason in The Peloponnesian War; ""... for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy"".",1

1851,a1851,b1851,"In his initial experiment published in 1960 (which does not mention the term ""confirmation bias"", he challenged participants to identify a rule applying to triples of numbers.","At the outset, they were told that (2,4,6) fits the rule.",1
1852,a1852,b1852,"Participants could generate their own triples and the experimenter told them whether or not each triple conformed to the rule.While the actual rule was simply ""any ascending sequence"", the participants had a great deal of difficulty in finding it, often announcing rules that were far more specific, such as ""the middle number is the average of the first and last"".",The participants seemed to test only positive examples—triples that obeyed their hypothesized rule.,1
1853,a1853,b1853,"For example, if they thought the rule was, ""Each number is two greater than its predecessor,"" they would offer a triple that fit this rule, such as (11,13,15) rather than a triple that violates it, such as (11,12,19).Wason accepted falsificationism, according to which a scientific test of a hypothesis is a serious attempt to falsify it.","He interpreted his results as showing a preference for confirmation over falsification, hence the term ""confirmation bias"".",1
1854,a1854,b1854,"In this task, participants are given partial information about a set of objects, and have to specify what further information they would need to tell whether or not a conditional rule (""If A, then B"") applies.","It has been found repeatedly that people perform badly on various forms of this test, in most cases ignoring information that could potentially refute the rule.A 1987 paper by Joshua Klayman and Young-Won Ha argued that the Wason experiments had not actually demonstrated a bias towards confirmation.",1
1855,a1855,b1855,"Instead, Klayman and Ha interpreted the results in terms of a tendency to make tests that are consistent with the working hypothesis.In light of this and other critiques, the focus of research moved away from confirmation versus falsification to examine whether people test hypotheses in an informative way, or an uninformative but positive way.","The search for ""true"" confirmation bias led psychologists to look at a wider range of effects in how people process information.Confirmation bias is often described as a result of automatic, unintentional strategies rather than deliberate deception.According to Robert MacCoun, most biased evidence processing occurs through a combination of both ""cold"" (cognitive) and ""hot"" (motivated) mechanisms.Cognitive explanations for confirmation bias are based on limitations in people's ability to handle complex tasks, and the shortcuts, called heuristics, that they use.Motivational explanations involve an effect of desire on belief, sometimes called ""wishful thinking"".Explanations in terms of cost-benefit analysis assume that people do not just test hypotheses in a disinterested way, but assess the costs of different errors.Psychologists Jennifer Lerner and Philip Tetlock distinguish two different kinds of thinking process.",1
1856,a1856,b1856,"Exploratory thought neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to a particular position, while confirmatory thought seeks to justify a specific point of view.","Lerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to justify their position to others whose views they already know, they will tend to adopt a similar position to those people, and then use confirmatory thought to bolster their own credibility.",1
1857,a1857,b1857,"However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification.Developmental psychologist Eve Whitmore has argued that beliefs and biases involved in confirmation bias have their roots in childhood coping through make-believe, which becomes ""the basis for more complex forms of self-deception and illusion into adulthood.""","The friction brought on by questioning as an adolescent with developing critical thinking can lead to the rationalization of false beliefs, and the habit of such rationalization can become unconscious over the years.In social media, confirmation bias is amplified by the use of filter bubbles, or “algorithmic editing”, which shows individuals information that they are more likely to agree with, while excluding opposing views.Confirmation bias can lead investors to be overconfident, ignoring evidence that their strategies will lose money.Raymond Nickerson, a psychologist, blames confirmation bias for the ineffective medical procedures that were used for centuries before the arrival of scientific medicine.Nickerson argues that reasoning in judicial and political contexts is sometimes subconsciously biased, favoring conclusions that judges, juries or governments have already committed to.Confirmation bias can be a factor in creating or extending conflicts, from emotionally charged debates to wars: by interpreting the evidence in their favor, each opposing party can become overconfident that it is in the stronger position.A two-decade study of political pundits by Philip E. Tetlock found that, on the whole, their predictions were not much better than chance.",1
1858,a1858,b1858,"Tetlock divided experts into ""foxes"" who maintained multiple hypotheses, and ""hedgehogs"" who were more dogmatic.","In general, the hedgehogs were much less accurate.",1
1859,a1859,b1859,"Tetlock blamed their failure on confirmation bias—specifically, their inability to make use of new information that contradicted their existing theories.A distinguishing feature of scientific thinking is the search for falsifying as well as confirming evidence.In the context of scientific research, confirmation biases can sustain theories or research programs in the face of inadequate or even contradictory evidence;An experimenter's confirmation bias can potentially affect which data are reported.","Data that conflict with the experimenter's expectations may be more readily discarded as unreliable, producing the so-called file drawer effect.",1
1860,a1860,b1860,"To combat this tendency, scientific training teaches ways to prevent bias.","For example, experimental design of randomized controlled trials (coupled with their systematic review) aims to minimize sources of bias.Social psychologists have identified two tendencies in the way people seek or interpret information about themselves.",1
1861,a1861,b1861,Self-verification is the drive to reinforce the existing self-image and self-enhancement is the drive to seek positive feedback.,"Both are served by confirmation biases.One factor in the appeal of alleged psychic readings is that listeners apply a confirmation bias which fits the psychic's statements to their own lives.As a striking illustration of confirmation bias in the real world, Nickerson mentions numerological pyramidology: the practice of finding meaning in the proportions of the Egyptian pyramids.When people with opposing views interpret new information in a biased way, their views can move even further apart.",1
1862,a1862,b1862,"This is called ""attitude polarization"".A less abstract study was the Stanford biased interpretation experiment in which participants with strong opinions about the death penalty read about mixed experimental evidence.","Twenty-three percent of the participants reported that their views had become more extreme, and this self-reported shift correlated strongly with their initial attitudes.Charles Taber and Milton Lodge argued that the Stanford team's result had been hard to replicate because the arguments used in later experiments were too abstract or confusing to evoke an emotional response.",1
1863,a1863,b1863,"The Taber and Lodge study used the emotionally charged topics of gun control and affirmative action.The backfire effect is a name for the finding that given evidence against their beliefs, people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly.","(compare the boomerang effect).—Lee Ross and Craig AndersonConfirmation biases can be used to explain why some beliefs persist when the initial evidence for them is removed.A common finding is that at least some of the initial belief remains even after a full debriefing.In another study, participants read job performance ratings of two firefighters, along with their responses to a risk aversion test.The continued influence effect is the tendency to believe previously learned misinformation even after it has been corrected.",1
1864,a1864,b1864,"Misinformation can still influence inferences one generates after a correction has occurred.Experiments have shown that information is weighted more strongly when it appears early in a series, even when the order is unimportant.","For example, people form a more positive impression of someone described as ""intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious"" than when they are given the same words in reverse order.One demonstration of irrational primacy used colored chips supposedly drawn from two urns.",1
1865,a1865,b1865,"Participants were told the color distributions of the urns, and had to estimate the probability of a chip being drawn from one of them.Another experiment involved a slide show of a single object, seen as just a blur at first and in slightly better focus with each succeeding slide.Illusory correlation is the tendency to see non-existent correlations in a set of data.Another study recorded the symptoms experienced by arthritic patients, along with weather conditions over a 15-month period.","Nearly all the patients reported that their pains were correlated with weather conditions, although the real correlation was zero.This effect is a kind of biased interpretation, in that objectively neutral or unfavorable evidence is interpreted to support existing beliefs.",1

1880,a1880,b1880,"Firecrests in the Balearic Islands and north Africa are widely recognised as a separate subspecies, but the population on Madeira, previously also treated as a subspecies, is now treated as a distinct species, the Madeira firecrest, Regulus madeirensis.",A fossil ancestor of the firecrest has been identified from a single wing bone.This kinglet is greenish above and has whitish underparts.,1
1881,a1881,b1881,"It has two white wingbars, a black eye stripe and a white supercilium.","The head crest, orange in the male and yellow in the female, is displayed during breeding, and gives rise to the English and scientific names for the species.",1
1882,a1882,b1882,"This bird superficially resembles the goldcrest, which largely shares its European range, but the firecrest's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive.","The song is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly lower-pitched than those of its relative.The common firecrest breeds in broadleaved or coniferous woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch.",1
1883,a1883,b1883,Seven to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone.,"Both parents feed the chicks, which fledge 22–24 days after hatching.",1
1884,a1884,b1884,"This kinglet is constantly on the move and frequently hovers as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits.","Despite some possible local declines, the species is not the subject of significant conservation concerns owing to its large European population and an expansion of its range over the last century.",1
1885,a1885,b1885,"It may be hunted and killed by birds of prey, and can carry parasites.","It is possible that this species was the original ""king of the birds"" in European folklore.The common firecrest is a small plump bird, 9 cm (3.5 in) in length with a wingspan of 13–16 cm (5.1–6.3 in), and weighs 4–7 grams (0.14–0.25 oz).",1
1886,a1886,b1886,"It has bright olive-green upperparts with a bronze-coloured patch on each shoulder, and whitish underparts washed with brownish-grey on the breast and flanks.","It has two white wingbars, a tiny black pointed bill, and brownish-black legs.",1
1887,a1887,b1887,"The head pattern is striking, with a black eye stripe, long white supercilium, and a crest which is bright yellow in the female and mainly orange in the male.","The sexes are very similar, apart from the crest colour, although the female is a little duller in plumage and on average slightly smaller.",1
1888,a1888,b1888,"Juveniles have a grey tinge to the duller upperparts, and lack the coloured crown; the other head markings are present, but duller than in the adult.","By their first winter, only the flight and tail feathers remain unmoulted, and the young birds are virtually indistinguishable from the adults in the field.",1
1889,a1889,b1889,"This kinglet usually hops with its body held horizontally, and its flight is weak and whirring, with occasional quick evasive turns.Adult firecrests are unlikely to be confused with any other species; Pallas's warbler has a similar head and wing pattern, but its crown stripe is pale lemon, not bright yellow or orange, and its supercilium is also pale yellow, not bright white.","The juvenile common firecrest might be confused with the goldcrest, but usually shows enough face pattern to distinguish it from its relative, which has a very plain face at all ages.",1
1890,a1890,b1890,The firecrest can also be separated from Pallas's warbler by the warbler's pale crown stripe and yellow rump.,"There is more likelihood of confusing the juvenile firecrest with the yellow-browed warbler, which has a similar head pattern; the warbler (an Asiatic species) has pale fringes to the feathers of the closed wing, a whitish belly and darker brown legs.",1
1891,a1891,b1891,"The yellow-browed warbler also lacks the pale half circle present below the young firecrest's eye.The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but frequently given family status,There are two widely recognised subspecies of common firecrest, nominate R. i. ignicapilla and Mediterranean R. i. balearicus (Jordans, 1923).","The latter form is found on the Balearic Islands and in north Africa, and is slightly paler below and greyer above than the nominate subspecies.",1
1892,a1892,b1892,"The proposed split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003,The flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan has sometimes been viewed as a race of the common firecrest; however, the flamecrest's territorial song, which resembles those of the Himalayan races of the goldcrest, and genetic data indicate that the flamecrest is closely related to the Himalayan goldcrest and only distantly to the two firecrest species.There are a few Pleistocene (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago) records from Europe and Israel of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species, but also a Spanish specimen of firecrest.","A left ulna from Bulgaria was identified as belonging to a fossil species, Regulus bulgaricus, from 2.6–1.95 mya.",1
1893,a1893,b1893,"This appears to be ancestral to the common firecrest, with the goldcrest diverging from this lineage in the Middle Pleistocene.The common firecrest breeds in lowland broadleaf forest, preferring cork oak and alder where available, otherwise beech and holly.","It also uses mixed broadleaf and conifer woodland, and stands of spruce, European silver fir, cedar and pines, often with undergrowth of juniper, ivy and wild rose.",1
1894,a1894,b1894,"In drier Mediterranean habitats it is found in conifers, evergreen oak, and mixed woodlands up to 2,800 m (9,200 ft).The nominate subspecies breeds in Europe from southern England, France, Spain and Portugal east to Belarus, northwestern Ukraine, and Greece, and north to the Baltic and southern Latvia.","There are isolated populations east of the main range in Abkhazia, the Crimea and Turkey.",1
1895,a1895,b1895,Its range lies between the 16 and 24 °C (61 and 75 °F) July isotherms.The common firecrest is monogamous.,"The male sings during the breeding season, often with its crest raised, and has a display  which involves pointing its bill at another bird, showing the crest and strong face pattern.",1
1896,a1896,b1896,"This differs from the display of the plainer-faced goldcrest, which bows its head to emphasise the crest.","The breeding territory is about 0.5 hectares (1.2 acres), and may overlap with neighbouring goldcrest territories.",1
1897,a1897,b1897,"Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests with the crest raised and a great deal of wing-fluttering,The nest is often suspended from a hanging branch usually at no great altitude, although Eric Simms reported nests at heights from 2.5 to 20 m (8.2 to 65.6 ft).","As is typical for the family, the nest is a closed cup built in three layers with a small entrance hole near its top.",1
1898,a1898,b1898,"The nest's outer layer is made from moss, small twigs, cobwebs and lichen, the spider webs also being used to attach the nest to the thin branches that support it.","The middle layer is moss, and this is lined with feathers (up to 3,000) and hair.",1
1899,a1899,b1899,"The nest is smaller, deeper and more compact than that of the goldcrest, about 8 cm (3.1 in) across and 5–7 cm (2.0–2.8 in) deep, with a wall thickness of about 2 cm (0.79 in).Laying starts in western Europe at the end of April, and in the east of the range in late May; second clutches, which are common, commence in June to July.",unlike those of Madeira firecrest which are described as like those of a Phylloscopus warbler (white with some brown speckles).,1
1900,a1900,b1900,"The eggs are 14 mm × 10 mm (0.55 in × 0.39 in) and weigh 0.7 g (0.025 oz), of which 5% is shell.Although their ranges overlap substantially, hybridisation between goldcrests and firecrests seems to be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns.","Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, and appeared to be poorly adapted compared to the parent species.All species of kinglet are almost exclusively insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders.",1
1901,a1901,b1901,"They also feed on the cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen.",All species will hover to catch flying insects.,1
1902,a1902,b1902,"Although the similarly sized firecrest and goldcrest are often found together, there are a number of factors that reduce direct competition for food.",Common firecrests prefer larger prey than goldcrests.,1
1903,a1903,b1903,"Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).The common firecrest feeds in trees, exploiting mainly the upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees.","This is in contrast to the goldcrest, which frequently feeds on the undersides of branches and leaves.",1
1904,a1904,b1904,"In winter, flocks of common firecrests cover a given distance about three times faster than do goldcrests, and ignore the smallest prey items preferred by their relative; large invertebrates are killed by beating them repeatedly against a branch.","The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; firecrests have broader bills with longer rictal bristles (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species.",1
1905,a1905,b1905,The firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting.,"Firecrests forage more often while standing, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding.",1
1906,a1906,b1906,"It also has a deep grooves in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while firecrests have a smoother underside to the foot.Young common firecrests are fed almost exclusively with springtails; larger food items are not accepted, and spiders are occasionally regurgitated.","From the fifth day onwards, the nestling diet includes aphids and a high amount of snail shells, the latter being needed for bone growth.",1
1907,a1907,b1907,"After the second week, the food includes larger moths and caterpillars, as well as various arthropods typically avoided by adults, such as harvestmen, earwigs, and centipedes.In winter, the firecrest joins loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers.The contact call is three or four thin high notes, similar to that of goldcrest, but slightly lower in pitch,The song of the Mediterranean subspecies of common firecrest, R. i. balearicus, is very similar to that of the nominate form, but one factor in separating the Madeiran firecrest from common firecrest is that the island bird's song is divided into three phrases, two of them consisting of modified display and anger calls.","Its display calls also use a larger frequency range and more harmonics than those of the continental subspecies.Throughout the firecrest's range, the main predator of small woodland birds is the Eurasian sparrowhawk, which takes avian prey as up to 98% of its diet.The invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is common in the Mediterranean area, and reduces arthropod numbers by removing most native ant species.",1
1908,a1908,b1908,"The reduction in prey items is greatest in the tree canopy, and has a greater effect on species like the firecrest that feed high in the foliage.","Less food is available for chicks, and parents have to spend more time foraging.Data on specific parasites of the firecrest is lacking, but the widespread moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae has been recorded in a related Regulus species.The common firecrest expanded its range in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,Population growth may be limited by lack of suitable habitat, and there may be local declines due to loss of conifers through storms or replacement by plantations of native deciduous trees.Aristotle and Pliny relate the legend of a contest amongst the birds to see who should be their king, the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest.",1
1909,a1909,b1909,"Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird which had hidden under the eagle's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title.","The confusion was assisted by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Ancient Greek words for the wren (βασιλεύς basileus, ""king"") and the crests (βασιλισκος basiliskos, ""kinglet"").",1

1927,a1927,b1927,Aldrin chose instead to fly fighters.,"He moved to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, where he learned to fly the F-80 Shooting Star and the F-86 Sabre.",1
1928,a1928,b1928,"Like most jet fighter pilots of the era, he preferred the latter.In December 1952, Aldrin was assigned to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was part of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing.","At the time it was based at Suwon Air Base, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Seoul, and was engaged in combat operations as part of the Korean War.The first Mig-15 he shot down was on May 14, 1953.",1

1934,a1934,b1934,"Aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at Nellis.Through the Air Force Institute of Technology, Aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1959, intending to earn a master's degree.Aldrin enjoyed the classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead.On the completion of his doctorate, Aldrin was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Los Angeles,Aldrin's initial application to join the astronaut corps when NASA's Astronaut Group 2 was selected in 1962 was rejected on the ground that he was not a test pilot.","He was aware of the requirement and asked for it to be waived, but the request was turned down.On completion of their initial astronaut training, each of the new astronauts was assigned a field of expertise that they were to specialize in.",1
1935,a1935,b1935,"In Aldrin's case, this was mission planning, trajectory analysis and flight plans.Jim Lovell and Aldrin were selected as the backup crew of Gemini 10, commander and pilot respectively.","Backup crews usually became the prime crew of the third following mission, but the last scheduled mission in the program was Gemini 12.Initially, Gemini 12's mission objectives were uncertain.",1
1936,a1936,b1936,"As the last scheduled mission, it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions.","While NASA had successfully performed rendezvous during Project Gemini, the gravity-gradient stabilization test on Gemini 11 was unsuccessful.",1
1937,a1937,b1937,NASA also had concerns about extravehicular activity (EVA).,"Cernan on Gemini 9 and Richard Gordon on Gemini 11 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during EVA, but Michael Collins had a successful EVA on Gemini 10, which suggested that the order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factor.It therefore fell to Aldrin to complete Gemini's EVA goals.",1
1938,a1938,b1938,NASA formed a committee to give him a better chance of success.,It dropped the test of the Air Force's astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU) that had given Gordon trouble on Gemini 11 so Aldrin could focus on EVA.,1
1939,a1939,b1939,"NASA revamped the training program, opting for underwater training over parabolic flight.","Aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training, but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest.",1
1940,a1940,b1940,"It also encouraged performing tasks quickly, whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately.","Training in a viscous, buoyant fluid gave a better simulation.",1
1941,a1941,b1941,"NASA also placed additional handholds on the capsule, which were increased from 9 on Gemini 9 to 44 on Gemini 12, and created workstations where he could anchor his feet.Gemini 12's main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle, and fly the spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity-gradient stabilization, perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three EVAs, and demonstrate an automatic reentry.","Gemini 12 also carried 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments.Gemini 12 was launched from Launch Complex 19 at Cape Canaveral on 20:46 UTC on November 11, 1966.",1
1942,a1942,b1942,The Gemini Agena Target Vehicle had been launched about an hour and a half before.The next task was to practice undocking and docking again.,"On undocking, one of the three latches caught, and Lovell had to use the Gemini's thrusters to free the spacecraft.",1
1943,a1943,b1943,Aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later.,"The flight plan then called for the Agena main engine to be fired to take the docked spacecraft into a higher orbit, but eight minutes after the Agena had been launched, it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure.",1
1944,a1944,b1944,The Mission and Flight Directors therefore decided not to risk the main engine.,This would be the only mission objective that was not achieved.Aldrin performed three EVAs.,1
1945,a1945,b1945,"The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft.","The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two.",1
1946,a1946,b1946,It set an EVA record of two hours and 20 minutes.,The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA.,1
1947,a1947,b1947,He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment.,"Aldrin performed numerous tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for Project Apollo.",1

1949,a1949,b1949,"A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.On November 15, the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, from whence they were picked up by a helicopter which took them to the awaiting aircraft carrier USS Wasp.Lovell and Aldrin were assigned to an Apollo crew with Neil Armstrong as Commander, Lovell as Command Module Pilot (CMP) and Aldrin as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP).","Their assignment as the backup crew of Apollo 9 was officially announced on November 20, 1967.",1
1950,a1950,b1950,"Due to design and manufacturing delays in the lunar module (LM), Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8.","Under the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo 8 prime crew, experienced trouble with his legs that required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine.Apollo 11 was the second crew of an American space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space,Early versions of the EVA checklist had the Lunar Module Pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface.",1
1951,a1951,b1951,"However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed.","Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft.",1
1952,a1952,b1952,"Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.An estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site.","The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone.",1
