"During the 1836 Presidential election Harding supported the Whig party candidate over the Democratic candidate and afterwards The Inquirer became known for its support of Whig candidates.Under James Elverson, The Philadelphia Inquirer declared, ""the new Inquirer shall be in all respects a complete, enterprising, progressive newspaper, moved by all the wide-awake spirit of the time and behind in nothing of interest to people who want to know what is going on every day and everywhere...steadily and vigorously Republican in its political policy, but just and fair in its treatment of all questions...""Between 1929 and 1936, while under Patenotre and Curtis-Martin, The Inquirer continued to support the Republican party and President Herbert Hoover, noticeably by not reporting on the news of the Great Depression."
63	a833	b833	For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see Electron properties.The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level.	Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels.
64	a793	b793	Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud.A nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match.	As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay.
65	a464	b464	Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans.With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid.	Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood.

247	a779	b779	One year earlier, in 1924, Louis de Broglie had proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves and, in 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom (Wave Mechanics) that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles.A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.The development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy.	The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge.

"On Romance Miguel covers twelve boleros (with each track being described as love numbers),""Inolvidable"" was released as Romance's lead single in November 1991.To promote the record, Miguel began his Romance Tour on 22 March 1992 at a sold out 10,000-seat National Auditorium in Mexico City."
279	a523	b1735	In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic.	Led by local party chairman James A. Finnegan, the Democrats also took fourteen of seventeen city council seats, and all of the citywide offices on the ballot.
280	a587	b1793	If this star had then exploded as a supernova, the resulting force would most likely have ejected the remnant from the system.	Renamed the Poelzig Building in honour of its architect, the building underwent a restoration and was opened as part of the university in 2001.
281	a1380	b1380	Melbourne had to appoint a new Commons leader and a new Chancellor (who by long custom, must be drawn from the Commons), but the only candidate whom Melbourne felt suitable to replace Althorp as Commons leader was Lord John Russell, who William (and many others) found unacceptable due to his radical politics.	William claimed that the ministry had been weakened beyond repair and used the removal of Lord Althorp—who had previously indicated that he would retire from politics upon becoming a peerThe King had a mixed relationship with Lord Melbourne.
282	a1187	b1187	"""Ponsford used a heavy bat—2 pounds 10 ounces (1.2 kg)—nicknamed ""Big Bertha""."	Opposition players sometimes joked that Ponsford's bat was larger than allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney, it was found to be slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting.Ponsford was a shy person, on the field and off.
283	a1505	b1505	The ships were significantly heavier than the Nassau class; the Helgoland-class ships displaced 22,808 tonnes (22,448 long tons) at a standard load, and 24,700 tonnes (24,310 long tons) at full load, nearly 4,000 tonnes (3,900 long tons) more than the earlier ships.The class had greatly improved handling characteristics over the preceding Nassau class.	The Helgolands were much better sea boats and did not suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did.
284	a834	b834	Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output.	(An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.)
285	a1486	b1179	This unit has also yielded crocodyliform and plesiosaur teeth and remains of the sauropod Lapparentosaurus.Ambondro was described on the basis of a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2).	They had two sons, Bill Jr. and Geoff.Baseball was a reasonably popular sport in Australia in the early 20th century and Ponsford alternated between cricket and baseball throughout his sporting life.
286	a212	b69	His friendship and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and three NBA championship series, are well documented.Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex,Earvin Johnson Jr. was born in Lansing, Michigan, the son of General Motors assembly worker Earvin Sr. and school janitor Christine.	Gearbox Software purchased the rights to the series from then-owners THQ in 2013, and released a remastered collection of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 in 2015 for Windows and macOS which was also highly regarded.Homeworld is a real-time strategy game set in space.
287	a1	b1	At the helm of HMAS Stuart in the Mediterranean from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and flotilla commander.	He then transferred to the South West Pacific as captain of the light cruiser HMAS Perth, and went down with his ship against heavy odds during the Battle of Sunda Strait in early 1942.Born in Benalla, Victoria, Waller entered the Royal Australian Naval College at the age of thirteen.

289	a1396	b1833	"The Canadiens retired his number, 9, in 1960, and in 1999 donated the Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard Trophy to the NHL, awarded annually to the league's regular season leading goal-scorer.The oldest of eight children, Richard emerged from a poverty-stricken family during the Great Depression."	They were also given further statements that made the apparent contradiction seem reasonable.
290	a1674	b169	The site argues that the match fixing issues of the final year of football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted.	Dissenter and Anglican lived side by side harmoniously: they were on the same town promotional committees; they pursued joint scientific interests in the Lunar Society; and they worked together in local government.
291	a192	b250	The police did not believe them, and stated that this was a criminal act, not a political one.The police used fibre optic camera technology for live surveillance, and monitored the actions and conversations of the gunmen from the audio and visual output.	"The group nearly swept Rolling Stone's 1992 end-of-year readers' polls, winning honours for ""Best Single"" (""One""), ""Artist of the Year"", ""Best Album"", ""Best Songwriter"" (Bono), ""Best Album Cover"", and ""Comeback of the Year"", among others."
292	a772	b772	"Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first subatomic particle to be discovered, which he originally called ""corpuscle"" but was later named electron, after particles postulated by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874."	He also showed they were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials.
293	a570	b1847	In Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017), Bana took on the role of Uther Pendragon, king of Britain and father of future King Arthur.In 1995, while working on the television series Full Frontal, Bana began dating Rebecca Gleeson, a publicist with the Seven Network and daughter of then Chief Justice of New South Wales, and later Chief Justice of Australia, Murray Gleeson.

295	a1512	b1002	The guns fired 45.3-kilogram (100 lb) shells at a muzzle velocity of 840 m/s (2,800 ft/s).	The hurricane made a final landfall on the Gulf Coast of Mexico near Tuxpan, Veracruz, with peak winds of 100 mph (155 km/h).
296	a1547	b1547	One Jain family produced several authors, including Mallikarjuna, the noted anthologist (1245); his brother-in-law Janna (1209), the court poet of King Veera Ballala II; Mallikarjuna's son Keshiraja (1260), considered by D. R. Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, to be the greatest theorist of Kannada grammar; and Sumanobana, who was in the court of King Narasimha I and was the maternal grandfather of Keshiraja.	Harihara (1160) and his nephew Raghavanka (1200), poets who set the trend for using native metres, came from a Shaiva family (devotees of the god Shiva).The support of the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada language was strong, and this is seen even in their epigraphs, often written in polished and poetic language, rather than prose, with illustrations of floral designs in the margins.Writers bilingual in Kannada and Telugu gained popularity which caused interaction between the two languages, a trend that continued into modern times.
297	a1160	b176	Cables from around the world applauded the new record-holder, including one from Frank Woolley, whose 305* was the previous highest score against Tasmania.Selected for his first Sheffield Shield match, against South Australia three weeks after his record-breaking innings, Ponsford—still batting down the order, at number five—made 108.	Town officials offered 100 guineas for information regarding the publication of the handbill and its author, to no avail.
298	a1011	b402	After tracking west-northwestward, the center of the storm moved ashore near Bluefields, Nicaragua, around 1800 UTC that day, producing winds of 40 mph (65 km/h).On September 17, Gert moved over the Gulf of Honduras, where it soon restrengthened into a tropical storm.	"There was no police or fire brigade to call, but London's local militia, known as the Trained Bands, was available for general emergencies, at least in principle, and watching for fire was one of the jobs of the watch, a thousand watchmen or ""bellmen"" who patrolled the streets at night."
299	a345	b345	"In 1951, Agaricales specialist Rolf Singer placed Rhodotus in the Amanitaceae because of similarities between the tribes Amaniteae and Rhodoteae, such as spore color and ornamentation (modifications of the spore wall that result in surface irregularities), structure of the hyphae and trama, and chlamydospore production during culture growth.In 1953, French mycologists  Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi placed Rhodotus in the family Tricholomataceae—a traditional ""wastebasket taxon""—on the basis of spore color.The use of molecular phylogenetics has helped to clarify the proper taxonomic placement of Rhodotus."	Studies of the ribosomal DNA sequences from a wide variety of agaric fungi have corroborated Kühner and Romagnesi's placement of Rhodotus in the Tricholomataceae as then understood.
300	a1865	b424	Participants were told the color distributions of the urns, and had to estimate the probability of a chip being drawn from one of them.Another experiment involved a slide show of a single object, seen as just a blur at first and in slightly better focus with each succeeding slide.Illusory correlation is the tendency to see non-existent correlations in a set of data.Another study recorded the symptoms experienced by arthritic patients, along with weather conditions over a 15-month period.	The services of the lightermen had suddenly become extremely expensive, and only the luckiest refugees secured a place in a boat.The fire spread quickly in the high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people abandoned attempts at extinguishing it and fled.
301	a575	b1256	Bana can often be seen at AFL games when he is back in Australia.Bana is an ambassador for Father Chris Riley's charity for homeless young people, Youth Off The Streets, and has appeared with Riley in advertisements to support the organisation's annual appeal.In 2005, Bana narrated the documentary Terrors of Tasmania about the endangered Tasmanian devil.	Beginning to board the helicopter, Henry spots an emotional Radar saluting him and pauses for a moment.
302	a625	b625	"As of May that year, the garrison comprised around 13,600 Imperial Japanese Army personnel commanded by Lieutenant General Shunsaburo Mugikura and 10,600 IJN personnel under Vice Admiral Chuichi Hara.The Truk garrison received few shipments of reinforcements or supplies following the capture of the Palau islands by US forces in September 1944, and historian David Hobbs has stated that it had been ""reduced to starving impotence"" by the time of Operation Inmate.The BPF's Truk attack force was designated Task Group 111.2, and comprised the 4th Cruiser Squadron and 24th Destroyer Flotilla."	The ships assigned to the 4th Cruiser Squadron were Implacable, the escort carrier HMS Ruler, the British cruisers HMS Swiftsure and Newfoundland, the Canadian cruiser HMCS Uganda and the New Zealand cruiser HMNZS Achilles.
303	a1280	b1280	In May 1910, after the planned marriage was announced, an infuriated Ben scuffled with his father outside the Blackstone Hotel and Boyce sustained a facial wound.	Ben was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $5 and court costs.
304	a451	b1356	They created firebreaks by blowing up houses on a large scale in the vicinity, halting the advance of the fire.	William, Duke of Clarence, was now second in the line of succession, preceded only by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York.
305	a1938	b1802	NASA formed a committee to give him a better chance of success.	The United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) and his staff occupied the building from 1949 to 1952.After 1952, the building served as the European centre of the American armed forces and the headquarters of the U.S. V Corps.
306	a241	b1222	Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded better than they originally thought.In February 1991, U2 moved the album's recording sessions to the seaside manor Elsinore in the Dublin suburb of Dalkey, renting the house for ₤10,000 per month.	American astrophysicist Ethan Siegel, who previously speculated that planets may have been ejected from the Solar System during an early dynamical instability, is skeptical of the existence of an undiscovered planet in the Solar System.The results of the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) suggest that the observed clustering is the result of a combination of observing bias and small number statistics.
307	a1624	b1624	Around 1969, however, Gauri invited him to join the Nasutions' band, Sabda Nada, as a replacement for their bassist Eddi Odek who was ill.The group was renamed Gipsy in 1969, which they considered more macho and Western-sounding.In 1972 Pontjo Nasution offered Chrisye the opportunity to play in New York.	Although ecstatic, Chrisye was afraid of telling his father, who he thought would disapprove of the idea.
308	a1796	b1796	"It was known as the ""Avestein"" as in Ave Maria but in the local Frankfurt dialect it was called the ""Affe Stein""."	In 1864, the city's psychiatric hospital  was erected on the site.
309	a1045	b1337	"Kostantiniyye (Ottoman Turkish: قسطنطينيه‎) and Be Makam-e Qonstantiniyyah al-Mahmiyyah (meaning ""the Protected Location of Constantinople"") and İstanbul were the names used alternatively by the Ottomans during their rule."	"1 TAF was at a ""dangerously low level"" and recommended that Jones fire Cobby and replace him with Air Commodore Frederick Scherger.Lieutenant General Kenney also became embroiled in the affair, having been informed by Bostock, and insisted on speaking directly to the pilots himself over Jones' protest that this was an internal RAAF disciplinary matter."
310	a437	b437	The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country.	The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames.
311	a1705	b885	By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base.To lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet (Admiral Reinhard Scheer) composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May.	Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of knowledge of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help.
312	a952	b952	"""Part of the reason why South Pacific is considered a classic is its confrontation of racism."	"According to professor Philip Beidler, ""Rodgers and Hammerstein's attempt to use the Broadway theater to make a courageous statement against racial bigotry in general and institutional racism in the postwar United States in particular"" forms part of South Pacific 's legend.From the early drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made the issue of racial prejudice central to the story."
313	a1881	b816	It has two white wingbars, a black eye stripe and a white supercilium.	The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin.
314	a517	b517	Hayes was promoted to brigadier general in October 1864 and brevetted major general.While serving in the Army of the Shenandoah in 1864, Hayes was nominated by Republicans to run for the House of Representatives from Ohio's 2nd congressional district.When the 39th Congress assembled in December 1865, Hayes was sworn in as a part of a large Republican majority.	Hayes identified with the moderate wing of the party, but was willing to vote with the radicals for the sake of party unity.Re-elected in 1866, Hayes returned to the lame-duck session to vote for the Tenure of Office Act, which ensured that Johnson could not remove administration officials without the Senate's consent.A popular Congressman and former Army officer, Hayes was considered by Ohio Republicans to be an excellent standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign.As a Republican governor with a Democratic legislature, Hayes had a limited role in governing, especially since Ohio's governor had no veto power.
315	a52	b202	Approved in 1974, construction on the replacement bridge started in October 1979.	They then gave preliminary statements to the police at Cannon Street police station.While on remand, Davies went on hunger strike.
316	a1859	b1859	Tetlock blamed their failure on confirmation bias—specifically, their inability to make use of new information that contradicted their existing theories.A distinguishing feature of scientific thinking is the search for falsifying as well as confirming evidence.In the context of scientific research, confirmation biases can sustain theories or research programs in the face of inadequate or even contradictory evidence;An experimenter's confirmation bias can potentially affect which data are reported.	Data that conflict with the experimenter's expectations may be more readily discarded as unreliable, producing the so-called file drawer effect.
317	a313	b1803	The great thing about memories is you're able to pass them along from generation to generation.	The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of the CIA in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'.
318	a843	b843	Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current.	The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible.
319	a473	b238	Promoted air vice marshal, he successively held the positions of Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Operational Command in 1961–62, AOC No.	Achtung Baby has since been acclaimed by writers and music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time.
320	a1750	b1750	When the Prime Minister Winston Field resigned in 1964, Harper was a front-runner to succeed him, but lost out to Ian Smith, who moved him to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.Each breakdown or setback during the early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him.	In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection.
321	a1770	b455	Upon the resumption of cricket in 1946, Morris made his Test debut against England and quickly made himself a core member of the team.	Food production and distribution had been disrupted to the point of non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread would be brought into the City every day, and safe markets set up round the perimeter.
322	a814	b34	This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1 u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram.	The connector runs due northward, and I-75/US 23 turns northwesterly to bypass around Kawkawlin.
323	a1500	b1927	"His thoughts on the matter were, ""The aim which I had to keep in view ... for technical and organizing reasons as well as reasons of political finance was to build as steadily as possible."	He moved to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, where he learned to fly the F-80 Shooting Star and the F-86 Sabre.
324	a182	b182	Hutton later wrote a narrative of the events:I was avoided as a pestilence; the waves of sorrow rolled over me, and beat me down with multiplied force; every one came heavier than the last.	My children were distressed.
325	a632	b1848	The final attack of the day was made by twelve Seafires which dive-bombed fuel tanks on Moen island.	One of them is partisanship for opinions and schools.
326	a325	b1369	"Jeter's ultimate zone rating (UZR) improved from worst in the AL for shortstops in 2007 to close to league average in 2008.When asked to respond to criticism of his defense, Jeter replied: ""I play in New York, man."	In the face of popular excitement, the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat in the House of Lords, and re-introduced the Bill, which still faced difficulties in the House of Lords.
327	a827	b827	When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field.	Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.The nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin.
328	a950	b1626	The national tour began in 1950 and grossed $3,000,000 in the first year, making $1,500,000 in profit.	The band often rehearsed late into the night; the indie project mixed Western rock and Balinese gamelan and was produced collaboratively.In late 1976 Chrisye was approached by songwriter Jockie Soerjoprajogo and Imran Amir, head of Prambors Radio, who asked him to provide the vocals for the Prambors Radio Teenage Songwriting Competition; Chrisye refused, as he did not want to sing an Indonesian pop song.
329	a56	b56	Defined along I-75/US 23 between Saginaw and Bay City, the designation was included in Public Act 142.	That act also affected another previously designated moniker between the two cities.
330	a181	b837	On 15 July, the mob liberated prisoners from the local gaol.	This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.Valency is the combining power of an element.
331	a1989	b813	Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon was chosen for all five Tests.By this time, Tallon was losing his hearing,Tallon missed selection during the 1951–52 season due his increasingly error-prone glovework and a combination of health reasons including stomach ulcers and deafness.He was unable to reclaim his Test place in 1952–53 despite making 133 against the touring South Africans and 84 against New South Wales for Queensland before the Tests.He was selected for the 1953 tour of England, and scored 76 against Tasmania before the tourists departed.Tallon retired in dramatic circumstances after the first match of the 1953–54 Sheffield Shield season.	One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about 7023602200000000000♠6.022×1023).
332	a1306	b1862	193.	Twenty-three percent of the participants reported that their views had become more extreme, and this self-reported shift correlated strongly with their initial attitudes.Charles Taber and Milton Lodge argued that the Stanford team's result had been hard to replicate because the arguments used in later experiments were too abstract or confusing to evoke an emotional response.
333	a847	b847	The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Spectra of excited states can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant stars.	Specific light wavelengths contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms.
334	a1734	b847	There was also a referendum on whether to consolidate the city and county governments.	Specific light wavelengths contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms.
335	a1358	b1358	Later that year, the incoming Prime Minister, George Canning, appointed him to the office of Lord High Admiral, which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709.	While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of Admiralty officers.
336	a841	b1997	By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas.	In 1867, one of the original 1804 dollars was sold at auction for $750 ($13,445 today).
337	a606	b389	When a new corona is generated, Cygnus X-1 transitions back to the hard state.The spectral transition of Cygnus X-1 can be explained using a two component advective flow solution, as proposed by Chakrabarti and Titarchuk.	Evacuation from London and resettlement elsewhere were strongly encouraged by Charles II, who feared a London rebellion amongst the dispossessed refugees.
338	a1398	b130	Richard was involved in a vicious on-ice incident late in the 1954–55 season during which he struck a linesman.	It was the first Eastern European congregation founded in New York City and the oldest Russian Jewish Orthodox congregation in the United States.Founded in 1852 by Rabbi Abraham Ash as Beth Hamedrash, the congregation split in 1859, with the rabbi and most of the members renaming their congregation Beth Hamedrash Hagodol.
339	a385	b385	The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of the English city of London from Sunday, 2 September to Thursday, 6 September 1666.The death toll is unknown but was traditionally thought to have been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded.	This reasoning has recently been challenged on the grounds that the deaths of poor and middle-class people were not recorded; moreover, the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims, leaving no recognisable remains.
340	a85	b113	Returning to Australia in June 1949, he served as the last Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Eastern Area and the inaugural AOC Home Command (now Air Command).	He played in eight Test matches for England from 1923 to 1933, achieving the rare feat of taking a wicket with his first ball in Test cricket.
341	a1588	b1588	With the waning of Jain literary output, competition between the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava writers came to the fore.	The Veerashaiva writer Chamarasa (author of Prabhulingalile, 1425) and his Vaishnava competitor Kumaravyasa (Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari, 1450) popularised the shatpadi metric tradition initiated by Hoysala poet Raghavanka, in the court of Vijayanagara King Deva Raya II.
342	a299	b886	The Yankees lost to the Seattle Mariners.After Fernández batted a disappointing .245 and appeared in only 108 games due to injuries in 1995, newly hired Yankees manager Joe Torre turned to Jeter for the 1996 season,Rated the sixth-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America heading into the 1996 season,The Yankees reached the 1996 postseason, and Torre batted Jeter in the leadoff spot based on his strong year-long performance.	Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties.
343	a1466	b1466	The Philadelphia Media Network moved to the new location in July 2012, consolidating the offices entirely on the third floor.	Cutbacks had left much of the 525,000 square feet (49,000 m2) within the Inquirer Building empty, but the 125,000-square-foot (12,000 m2) east Market Street location consolidated Philadelphia Media's departments, including the Daily News' newsroom with The Inquirer's.
344	a388	b388	The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence.	On Tuesday, the fire spread over most of the City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten King Charles II's court at Whitehall.
345	a1769	b1769	Originally trained in spin bowling, Morris developed as a batsman during his teens and during the 1940–41 season became the first player in the world to score two centuries on his first-class debut.	His career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served in the Australian Army and gained selection in its rugby union team.
346	a864	b864	The piece won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1950.	Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic.
347	a967	b967	"The CD includes the bonus tracks ""Loneliness of Evening"" (recorded in 1949 by Mary Martin), ""My Girl Back Home"" (Martin), ""Bali Ha'i"" (Pinza) and Symphonic Scenario for Concert Orchestra (original orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett)."	"According to critic John Kenrick, the original cast recording ""is the rare stuff that lasting legends are made of"", an essential classic.Masterworks Broadway released a recording of the 1967 Lincoln Center production starring Florence Henderson as Nellie, Giorgio Tozzi as Emile, Justin McDonough as Cable and Irene Byatt as Bloody Mary."

610	a1351	b1202	"But there are such things more or less in all families."""	The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, A previous article reported that if the massive disk extended beyond 80 AU some objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn would have been left in high inclination (inc &gt; 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.The gravitational influence of Planet Nine would explain four peculiarities of the Solar System:Planet Nine was initially proposed to explain the clustering of orbits, via a mechanism that would also explain the high perihelia of objects like Sedna.
611	a1225	b1225	The self-gravity of this disk would cause its spontaneous organization, increasing the inclinations of the objects and aligning the arguments of perihelion, forming it into a cone above or below the original plane.Antranik Sefilian and Jihad Touma propose that a massive disk of moderately eccentric TNOs is responsible for the clustering of the longitudes of perihelion of the eTNOs.	Their predicted 10 Earth-mass disk would contain TNOs with aligned orbits and eccentricities that increased with their semimajor axes ranging from zero to 0.165.

623	a1226	b1226	The gravitational effects of this disk would offset the forward precession driven by the giant planets so that the orbital orientations of its individual objects are maintained.	The orbits of objects with high eccentricities, such as the observed eTNOs, would be stable and have roughly fixed orientations, or longitudes of perihelion, if their orbits were anti-aligned with this disk.The Planet Nine hypothesis includes a set of predictions about the mass and orbit of the planet.

"Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning.Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness (""Showtime"") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit (""Celtic Pride""), and between blacks and whites.Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 Converse shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies.In 2009, Johnson and Bird collaborated with journalist Jackie MacMullan on a non-fiction book titled When the Game Was Ours."

Turkish forces of the Ankara government, commanded by Şükrü Naili Pasha (3rd Corps), entered the city with a ceremony on 6 October 1923, which has been marked as the Liberation Day of Istanbul (Turkish: İstanbul'un Kurtuluşu) and is commemorated every year on its anniversary.Ankara was selected as Turkey's capital in 1923 to distance the new, secular republic from its Ottoman history.
640	a1857	b1857	"However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification.Developmental psychologist Eve Whitmore has argued that beliefs and biases involved in confirmation bias have their roots in childhood coping through make-believe, which becomes ""the basis for more complex forms of self-deception and illusion into adulthood."""	The friction brought on by questioning as an adolescent with developing critical thinking can lead to the rationalization of false beliefs, and the habit of such rationalization can become unconscious over the years.In social media, confirmation bias is amplified by the use of filter bubbles, or “algorithmic editing”, which shows individuals information that they are more likely to agree with, while excluding opposing views.Confirmation bias can lead investors to be overconfident, ignoring evidence that their strategies will lose money.Raymond Nickerson, a psychologist, blames confirmation bias for the ineffective medical procedures that were used for centuries before the arrival of scientific medicine.Nickerson argues that reasoning in judicial and political contexts is sometimes subconsciously biased, favoring conclusions that judges, juries or governments have already committed to.Confirmation bias can be a factor in creating or extending conflicts, from emotionally charged debates to wars: by interpreting the evidence in their favor, each opposing party can become overconfident that it is in the stronger position.A two-decade study of political pundits by Philip E. Tetlock found that, on the whole, their predictions were not much better than chance.

It sits on the riverbank below the castle.The machine was built with drawings from the Danish living history museum Middelaldercentret, who, in 1989, were the first to recreate a fully functioning trebuchet.The trebuchet takes eight men half an hour to load and release.
698	a461	b765	A special Fire Court was set up to deal with disputes between tenants and landlords and decide who should rebuild, based on ability to pay.	Democritus's atomism was refined and elaborated by the later philosopher Epicurus (341–270 BC).In the fourteenth century, the rediscovery of major works describing atomist teachings, including Lucretius's De rerum natura and Diogenes Laërtius's Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, led to increased scholarly attention on the subject.
699	a1057	b1057	The deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915 was among the major events which marked the start of the Armenian Genocide during WWI.	The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918 and the Allies occupied Constantinople on 13 November 1918.

703	a1650	b1650	The new album, which retained the title Badai Pasti Berlalu, cost Rp.800 million (US$95,000) to produce and promote, in part owing to the cost of employing an Australian orchestra, the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra.In 2001 Chrisye released the studio album Konser Tur 2001 (Concert Tour 2001), which included two new songs and several old ones.	"The music video for one of the new songs, ""Setia"" (""Loyal""), was controversial owing to its portrayal of a woman in tight clothing."
704	a1056	b1056	The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.Sultan Abdul Hamid II was deposed with the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 and the Ottoman Parliament, closed since 14 February 1878, was reopened 30 years later on 23 July 1908, which marked the beginning of the Second Constitutional Era.	A series of wars in the early 20th century, such as the Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912) and the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), plagued the ailing empire's capital and resulted in the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état, which brought the regime of the Three Pashas.The Ottoman Empire joined World War I (1914–1918) on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated.
705	a1685	b345	During the Blitz, a bomb fell on the North Bank, destroying the roof and setting fire to the scrap that was being stored on the terrace.

716	a822	b956	A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay.	"Although Billis operates a laundry – Nellie particularly praises his pleats – and appears in a grass skirt in the ""Thanksgiving Follies"", these acts are consistent with his desire for money and are clearly intended to be comic."
717	a305	b791	Game 4 marked the first time that any non-exhibition MLB game had been played in the month of November.Jeter batted .297, with 18 home runs, 75 RBIs, 124 runs scored, 191 hits, and a career-best 32 stolen bases during the 2002 regular season.	The total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide.
718	a1831	b1831	Heightened confidence levels decrease preference for information that supports individuals' personal beliefs.Another experiment gave participants a complex rule-discovery task that involved moving objects simulated by a computer.—Michael ShermerConfirmation biases are not limited to the collection of evidence.	Even if two individuals have the same information, the way they interpret it can be biased.A team at Stanford University conducted an experiment involving participants who felt strongly about capital punishment, with half in favor and half against it.The participants, whether supporters or opponents, reported shifting their attitudes slightly in the direction of the first study they read.
719	a1064	b1099	The people of Istanbul remain concerned that an even more catastrophic seismic event may be in the city's near future, as thousands of structures recently built to accommodate Istanbul's rapidly increasing population may not have been constructed properly.In the Köppen–Geiger classification system, Istanbul has a borderline Mediterranean climate (Csa), humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and oceanic climate (Cfb), due to its location in a transitional climatic zone.	Opposition candidate Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu came second with 41.08% and the HDP pro-Kurdish and left-wing candidate Selahattin Demirtaş won a substantial 9.09%.
