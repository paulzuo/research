Janssen titled her study of Egyptology at UCL The First Hundred Years ""as a tribute"" to Murray.Murray's witch-cult theories provided the blueprint for the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca,Noting that there is no evidence of Wicca existing before the publication of Murray's books, Merrifield commented that for those in 20th century Britain who wished to form their own witches' covens, ""Murray may have seemed the ideal fairy godmother, and her theory became the pumpkin coach that could transport them into the realm of fantasy for which they longed"".Ethan Doyle White, 2016.Murray's witch-cult theories were likely also a core influence on the non-Gardnerian Wiccan traditions that were established in Britain and Australia between 1930 and 1970 by the likes of Bob Clay-Egerton, Robert Cochrane, Charles Cardell, and Rosaleen Norton.Members of the Wiccan community gradually became aware of academia's rejection of the witch-cult theory."
